I find it a lot easier to avoid attacks from multiple enemies in 3rd person, as you can watch your flanks more easily, and it's harder to get tripped up on terrain.  Also, avoiding attacks by moving backwards is more efficient if you do it by facing perpendicular to your target and side-stepping, and it's easier to do that in 3rd for me.  ",,0,0,t1_cquf884

The other two acted because they're psychopaths and they could. He was desperate and made mistakes, but it was because of the decisions he made. Every time he came to a crossroads in his life, he made a decision that took him farther away from the man that he started the series as. Not once did he seriously consider turning his back on cooking and trying to make amends. Every decision was conscious and ""logical,"" and brought him closer to being the man that he became. He fell into the role that he created for himself. The scary part about him was that he wasn't a psychopath; he was a husband with a wife and kids, who started as normal guy and ended up an evil human being, not because of what someone did to him, but because of choices he made thinking they were the right thing to do. He is evil because deep down, he believes all the decisions he made were the right ones. That man was there all along, waiting to get out.",,0,0,t1_cquhx7x

A post-modernist take on the style in question, which means that it takes the tropes of that style and criticizes and/or deconstructs them. 2. Influenced by music fitting the above definition (usually post-punk, post-hardcore, or post-rock), without necessarily being post-modernist itself. 3. ""Happened after."" Sometimes I see groove metal referred to as post-thrash because it's a thing that happened after thrash.  And like Bronan said, not a super useful label because it usually doesn't do much to describe the music. Most post-metal is atmospheric and/or progressive sludge.

Both the average and median ""age at first marriage"" varied considerably across different parts of Western Europe and the American colonies in this period.  The following in based onthe book *The History of the European Family: Family life in early modern times (1500-1789)*, edited by David I. Kertzer and Marzio Barbagli  Contrary to popular sterotypes, young men and women in Early Modern Times had remarkably similar marraige patterns to the late 20th century -- The beestCanturbury, England in the 1690s, average age at first marriage was 26 for Women, and 28 for men.  The medivan values are a little lower, but not much.  In fact, age at first marraige seems to have reached a high of 26-30 for both men and women in the late 17th century, and then declined slightly over the course of the 18th century, by which point age at first marraige was close to 25 years old for men, and around 22 years old for women.  Keep in mind that these are averages.  I havn't read that book in several years, but I also want to mention that this varied regionally as well as over time.  Finally, most of these demographic data is based on church records of marragies, deaths, and births.  Relationships that took place outside of the state appartus don't show up in our records, nor do the family lives of religious and ethnic minorities (Jews, Roma, Basques, Travellers, etc).     Also, this data really only applies to urban-dwellers in France, England, Germany, and Northern Italy.  In other parts of Europe, and the greater Mediterrian basin, as well as in rural areas, there are some signs that these numbers are probably a little too high.  Basically, though, functional leigtimized teenage marraige was nowhere nearly as common as popular media suggests, at least for ordinary people in the period 1500-1800.  **TL;DR: For Western Europe, mid-to-late 20s was common for both men and women in the period 1500s-1790s.  However, the the discrepancy between the mean and the median suggests there's some important social and regional differences that complicate the picture.**",,0,0,t3_34fvyc

You put commas around an appositive when it is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. You leave them off if the sentence doesn't work without the information in the appositive.  In the case of proper nouns, the use of commas depends on the context. If I have multiple sisters, then the extra information is necessary to describe who I'm talking about, and her name should not be in commas. But if I only have one sister, then saying ""my sister"" narrows it down to one person, and thus her name is not essential and should be set off by commas.   http://snarkygrammarguide.blogspot.com/2010/08/commas-accentuating-appositive.html",,0,0,t1_cquqms9

From what I know, almost everything you're saying should be impossible for a Tulpa to do. Now I don't know much about Tulpas or how they work, but I take the Psychological stand point and understand what a Tulpa is and isn't. Let me break down some of the things here for you:  * ""she mentioned something about ""beings"" being around me at all times"" Tulpas are in your mind, they can not be ""sensed"" by anybody but yourself. She might have been able to pick it up from how you were acting if you were looking around at them or something but that's a slight chance. * ""either blocking my way or just leading me to certain places of the house"" What you are describing sounds like a somehow self-imposed Tulpa, one that was able to put itself in the environment without your explicit permission, however this sentence doesn't make sense in that case. Tulpas are not, and can never be (outside of the wonderland) physical beings, if you put enough pressure on an imposed Tulpa you will go right through them. I see no way in which they can actually block you from doing something. * ""I have also noticed certain things moving, not just in my inmediate vicinity but also other parts of the house"" This is impossible. Period. A Tulpa is a being of your mind, it can not interact with the physical world by any means other than possibly controlling you to interact with it. * ""The last occasion was something noticeable not only by me, but also friends."" If people other than you can notice your tulpa doing something, it's not a Tulpa. A door opening abruptly is not something a Tulpa can do. Other people are also not capable of hearing your Tulpa, only you would be able to.  So as far as I can tell, this isn't a Tulpa. As for what it is, I don't know, Ghosts? Demons? I guess that will depend on what your stand point on all these things are, but a Tulpa simply is not capable of doing what you are describing. Proceed with caution my friend, you're going into unknown (well, as far as we know unknown) territory. Note again, I'm fairly new to Tulpas myself, so I could be completely wrong in saying it's not a Tulpa, but all of this is accumulative of everything that I've read from other people on what Tulpas are, aren't, and what they can and can't do.

Then consider the number  - *Q* = 5(*p*_1 *p*_2 *p*_n)^(2) - 1.  (Note: this is a slight modification of your definition of *Q*. The important thing to note is that *Q* = -1 = 4 (mod 5), as above, and that we're trying to deduce that this *Q* also has a prime divisor *not* enumerated above. Further, *Q* is *odd*, so 2 does not divide *Q*.)  So from here, the claim is that any such prime dividing *Q* must satisfy (*p*/5) = 1. *Assume* for now that you can establish this. (I'll return to this below.)  Note that *Q* = 4 = -1 (mod 5). Further, none of the existing *p*_i's enumerated above can divide *Q*. (Consider *Q* (mod *p*_i) for each *i*.) That means there must be an additional prime not on that list which divides *Q*. Can we also show that one such prime divisor is congruent to 4 (mod 5)?  Now, (*p*/5) implies *p* = 1 or 4 (mod 5), either by reciprocity or inspection. You can't have all of these ""new"" prime divisors of *Q* be 1 (mod 5), since that would mean *Q* itself would be 1 (mod 5) rather than 4 (mod 5). After all, if *q*_1, *q*_2, ..., *q*_m are the distinct positive prime divisors of *Q*, and all are 1 (mod 5), then any product of them will likewise be 1 (mod 5), unlike *Q*. (Oh, and a quick footnote: by construction, *Q* must be *odd*, so none of those prime divisors is 2.) Therefore, not only must *Q* have a prime divisor not on that original list, but at least one such prime divisor must be congruent to 4 (mod 5).  ---  OK, so how to prove that (*p*/5)=1 in the first place for any odd prime *p* such that *p*|*Q*? Well, for any such *p*, there exists a *d* in **N** such that  - *pd* = 5*P*^(2)-1,  where *P* := (product over all the *p*_i's). We want to determine (*p*/5), so let's consider the above equation modulo 5:  - *pd* = -1 (mod 5).  Since *pd* = *Q* is nonzero modulo 5 (why?), by inspection, *pd* = -1 (mod 5) if and only if  - *p* = -*d* (mod 5).  (To verify this, consider the various cases modulo 5.) Substituting this back into the congruence, we obtain  - -*p*^(2) = -1 (mod 5),  or equivalently,  - *p* = 1 or 4 (mod 5).  Ah, but (1/5) = (1^(2)/5) = 1, and (4/5) = (2^(2)/5) = 1. Therefore, if *p* is a positive prime such that *p*|*Q*, we must have (*p*/5)=1.  ---  OK, that was a bit of a slog, but hopefully you could follow the idea. Good luck!",,1430459693,0,t3_34h0om

Off to math I guess.  Let's define T(n) to be the time it takes to sort n cards, where we measure time in number of shuffles (so ignoring checking and shuffling times, both of which are O(n)).  E[T(1)]=1 because trivial case.  For n cards to be shuffled, we first need to shuffle (n-1) cards, which we expect to take E[T(n-1)] time, and then get a correct bogosort of n cards which happens with probability 1/n!. The expected number of tries until a success is hit is then n! (it follows the well known geometric distribution).  Thus, E[T(n)]=E[T(n-1)]*n! (we need to sort (n-1) objects a total of n! times before we expect it to be correct). So the expected time is some superfactorial?      n  E[T(n)]     1  1     2  2     3  12     4  288     5  34560     6  24883200     7  125411328000  And I completely didn't account for any checking or shuffling. Which probably increase each final result by *at least* another n!.   So n=7 gives ~10^11. n!~10^nlogn &gt;10^n , so to reach 10^100 we only need about 15 cards.   So 15 cards will remain unshuffled till heat death of the universe?",,0,0,t1_cquqqmj

When you know the enemy has AKs and AWPs, there is no reason to buy a helmet. Since both weapons instantly kill someone when hit in the head, you can better use the extra cash in buying a smoke, flash or anything like that.  When you get hit for lets say 40% armor and still have 60% left, it honestly wouldn't be worth it to reinvest in extra armor. Once it drops below 40% i'd say its best to 'refresh' your armor by buying it again.

Person B has a diet consisting mostly of carbs and sugar, low fiber and protein (which is exactly what the USDA argues for sadly, 75% of calories from carbs alone, never touch fat and only eat 50 grabs of protein a day)  Person A is going to have to try a lot less to not overeat than Person B.

TB didn't even bother to play Devil's Advocate as he usually does. The guests agreed 100% of the time.""**  It was a discussion, just not one you are saying you wanted it to be. It was a discussion about what exactly Valve did wrong, and their personal opinions and reactions to what had occurred. This wasn't meant to be a middle of the aisle debate, it's a conversation between 3 people who have a similar view on the subject.   **""The comment that the minority...""**  It actually did cross many peoples minds, and they like myself don't agree with the notion mods can't be a business. They absolutely can.  **"" They are of the opinion that money drives everything.""**  Money drives everything involved in a market. Net neutrality concerning the companies in the US is very different because of infrastructure and financial ties to government. Mods that cost money are still perfectly applicable to this concept.  **""They didn't bother to talk about a donation system. Instead they spent their entire time talking about how forcing people to pay for mods is a good thing.""**  First of all, noone said you were forced to pay for mods, you have the right as a consumer to not buy a product you don't feel justifies the cost. Second, they did mention donations, in the very beginning, and Robin said the community response was that donations amount to a very little amount. This confirms others modders account on /r/skyrimmods when they receive 1 donation after hundreds of thousands of downloads.  **""The minority(which totally exists) is all little children and grandmothers. Yes, this was actually said in a rather hypocritical fashion.""**  It was said in a manner to not as much say that these people are little children and grandmothers, but more the reaction they gave was childish and hopefully the people giving these reactions were kids who felt personally attacked by the concept of paid mods because of their lack of income.  The minority they discuss was described as the raging vocal group that filled areas of discussion like this sub for those few days. I'm sorry but they are a minority when compared to all gamers involved and the modding community as a whole.   **""They refuse to make assumptions about Valve or Bethesda, but were more than willing to assume the people against it were a minority. On top of that, that this minority(remember anyone against this is a minority) all display the attributes of a small group of people making death threats.""**  This minority is people making specific arguments and acting is a certain way, not anyone against this idea, anyone demanding they are entitled to free mods and that valve should remove the entire system instead of adjusting it.  **""They didn't bother to talk about the majority of the issues brought up by the so-called minority that they hate.""**  They talked about the important ones that were splitting the community. I don't think there is much of a divide on subject on the split of the payment and such.  **""There was not even a ""minority"" person on the show to discuss another perspective.""**  The perspective of one of those in the minority was not needed. We got the perspective of a modder whose been in the field for a long period of time, and the head of a vast modding community, their views are arguably vastly more important than the person they consider in the minority. (Again, read what I wrote is their definition of those in the minority.)  **""Both of the guests said they would receive money from Valve for the paid modding. They both have something to gain, and as such this constitutes a conflict of interest.""**  Absolutely not, well atleast not the modder specifically. The entire point of the discussion hovers around the potential for modders to make money from their work. Having a modder who intends to sell his mods is perfectly acceptable and the head of nexus is an excellent choice because even though he was offered money, he is still the head of a community that will encourage and only offer free mods, thus he is invested in the modding community outside of the paid aspect.  **""They think the opinions of the creators constitute the the opinion of the majority of consumers of mods. ""**  No, but their opinions are vastly more important on the subject of mods being sold than the average person.   **"" it never crosses their mind how someone might have a legitimate concern about being forced to pay for a mod that might become outdated.""**  Again, you are in no way forced to pay, saying this is ignorant to your rights as a consumer. And they were specifically bringing this up concerning involving curation and such. I have absolutely no problem and noone would with valve having some form of QA. This was their and many others main concern, people were demanding valve completely remove the system (This is the minority they were talking about) instead of adjusting it to be better.  **""but this is one instance where he is wrong.""**  Not at all, I've disagreed with him in the past but he is absolutely on point with this one and you are wrong on many points, specifically the fact you think you are ""forced"" to buy paid mods which is no way the case and makes me wonder if you know what forced means.

In the (for sake of argument, I'm applying quotation marks) ""real"" world, he can shut off a couple machines remotely and connect to the Matrix without hooking up to a machine.  Not even close, right?  In my opinion, the official explanation (which was still left out of the sequels and may not have even been conceived at the time of writing them, thus still making it a flaw), that Neo is part of an experiment on the Machines' part to build essentially wifi into the humans, but his function as the One allows him to manipulate this, is far better.",,0,0,t1_cqui7np

(I only have 3 lustrates per aetherflow CD and 1 won't usually take you to full hp meaning I need to use 2 - 3 at a time depending on dmg and all). I've done it sometimes but other times they die. (depends on certain factors. usually tanks that take a lot of dmg during his 'big pull' and tanks who can't get all the mobs in time before they kill me due to having to heal him or he'd die anyway)  What annoys me the most is tanks that do big pulls, use no buffs and then after they die, they say ""small pulls it is then"" as if it's my fault that they pulled everything and then proceeded to not care about how much dmg they were taking. ""buffs? pfft, who needs them"" type of thing.  Some tanks don't even bother to look at the gear of their party before their big pulls. Chances are if one or both DPS are new and in weak gear, big pulls probably won't die fast enough.  As a WAR, I always make sure to use buffs and also to do pulls that I am reasonably sure both myself and the healer can handle. (if it's a healer who is reasonably lower geared, I wouldn't risk big pulls, medium pulls maybe though. depends on the dungeon).  I also use holmgang at the end of any big pulls to give the healer some breathing room. (you don't need to wait until you're almost dead to use holmgang/hallowed ground during these pulls. Have some foresight and see that it could help avoid wipes/help your healer a lot).  I don't see a lot of tanks do this but one time I saw a tank in SVHM I think it was. After every big pull, he would use hallowed usually which gave enough time to heal them even if they were a little bit out in front of us for whatever reason.  tl;dr: Tanks need to have some awareness, check party members gear, how much the group can handle, have some foresight and use holmgang/hallowed early on as a catch up tool for the healer to keep you alive instead of trying to use it when your almost dead and dying because of it.",,0,0,t3_34es4g

[**Euclid's proof**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem#Euclid.27s_proof) of article  [**Euclid%27s theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s%20theorem): [](#sfw)   ---  &gt;  &gt;[Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid) offered the following proof published in his work *[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements)* (Book IX, Proposition 20),  which is paraphrased here.  &gt;Consider any finite list of prime numbers *p*1, *p*2, ..., *p**n*. It will be shown that at least one additional prime number not in this list exists. Let *P* be the product of all the prime numbers in the list: *P* = *p*1*p*2...*p**n*. Let *q* = *P* + 1. Then *q* is either prime or not:  &gt;   &gt;* If *q* is prime, then there is at least one more prime than is in the list.  &gt;   &gt;* If *q* is not prime, then some [prime factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor) *p* divides *q*. If this factor *p* were on our list, then it would divide *P* (since *P* is the product of every number on the list); but *p* divides *P* + 1 = *q*. If *p* divides *P* and *q,* then *p* would have to divide the difference  of the two numbers, which is (*P* + 1) − *P* or just 1. Since no prime number divides 1, this would be a contradiction and so *p* cannot be on the list. This means that at least one more prime number exists beyond those in the list.  &gt;This proves that for every finite list of prime numbers there is a prime number not on the list, and therefore there must be infinitely many prime numbers.  &gt;Euclid is often erroneously reported to have proved this result by [contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction), beginning with the assumption that the set initially considered contains all prime numbers, or that it contains precisely the *n* smallest primes, rather than any arbitrary finite set of primes.  Although the proof as a whole is not by contradiction (it does not assume that only finitely many primes exist), a proof by contradiction is within it, which is that none of the initially considered primes can divide the number *q* above.  &gt;  ---    ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqurdu1) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqurdu1)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",,0,0,t1_cqurdn5

To answer your second question first, as it's the easiest, no they aren't limited AT ALL. Every class can use every weapon and every armor type and you'll see why that's important when I answer the second question. Basically if you wanted to be a Dragonknight in light armor with a restoration staff and heal people, you could.  On the topic of customization, this game has some of the most customization that there is on the market. The game uses a LAS or ""limited action set"" as your actionbar. Basically, you choose 5 abilities and an ultimate. That's it.  Your skill menu will have class skills with 3 sections (for DK there's a fire section, a dragon section, and an earth section), Weapon abilities, World abilities, and Guild abilities. Each of these sections has skills for you to choose. So if you wanted to pick up a 2h weapon and DPS as dragonknight you could mix 2h weapon skills with your class skills on your bar. I should also mention, you get 2 weapon sets that you swap between in combat. 2h/bow or dual wield/bow are the most common physical DPS combos for example.  You get abilities via skill points (which I mentioned previously). Leveling gives one skill point, every 3 skyshards gives 1, and some quests award them. Also, every level you can put a point in Magicka (class, staff, and mage's guild abilities), Health, or Stamina (weapon, Fighter's Guild, and Undaunted abilities).  Also, once you hit ""Veteran Levels"" you'll get into the Champion system which is basically a talent system that gives you minor boosts to your stats for progressing through end-game content and such.  And as with most MMOs, EVERY build you can think of is at least semi-viable, however there are obviously certain combinations which are better than others.  TL;DR Customization for days, every class can be every role, play what you want(unless you wanna be the very best like no one ever was).",,0,0,t1_cquqozt

Usually ones that aren't as painful, which it sounded they were quick to point out was the case.  Or are you simply saying it was awkward?

Also, you can imagine the improvements to the servers that would be required to run a bunch of calculations at twice the speed.  By upgrading to 128 tick it would not only increase the amount of calculations but it also increases the amount of data that needed to be sent both directions. Simply changing the server vars to 128 tick wouldn't fix anything. In fact it'd likely make all the servers perform worse since they'd be attempting to make and send calculations at a rate that the hardware doesn't support. All of that for a marginal difference in hit registration and input doesn't really make sense for valve. Also, because it puts a large strain on the user, it fucks the people with lower end systems or less-than-stellar internet connections.  It's really hard to draw a parallel without going to massive extremes, but basically it isn't worth it. No matter how many butthurt people cry about how they should've killed X guy or the hit reg in MM is shit, that 7 millisecond difference in update speeds will always be exactly that.

They are characteristically described as frugal, and interested in [personal grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_grooming).  Under this categorization scheme, men and women are either herbivore type (草食系, *sōshoku-kei* ?) or carnivore type (肉食系, *nikushoku-kei* ?). As of September 2010, 36% of Japanese men between the ages of 16 and 19 perceived themselves in this way.  Additionally, two surveys of single men in their 20s and 30s found that 61% and 70%, respectively, considered themselves grass-eating men.  This phenomenon is viewed by the Japanese government as a leading cause in the nation's declining birth rate, prompting the government to provide incentives for couples that have children, including payouts and free health care.   &gt;  ---  ^Interesting: [^Masahiro ^Morioka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Morioka) ^| [^Herbivore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore) ^| [^Aging ^of ^Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan) ^| [^Celibacy ^syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy_syndrome)   ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqurdyt) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqurdyt)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",,0,0,t1_cqurdnr

For a cause that is screaming that they have been oppressed and mistreated... to then target other ethnicity that have also been oppressed in US...  regardless of your cause, the moment you attempt to murder someone else ""in the moment"" and especially when you go out of your way to find someone else of a different ethnicity to rob and beat up because they aren't your color... then you are a hypocrite and an asshole and you fucking know you ain't doing this for the movement.  The movement gave you an excuse to do the shit you wanted to do.  Tarnishing the actual movement and seeding the hate even deeper among those whom you attacked.... those allies whom served in your communities will forever remember this and never hesitate to assume the worst when you walk into their businesses.  If they see you and think you are there to rob them, it is because of this.  You gave them a reason to think of you as animals. So next time you tried to shout race card, they can shout you guys almost murdered me before.       I hope all non black businesses leave... If they want to destroy their communities, then let them do so. Fuck it.  Let them run their own businesses so they can destroy it and can't point fingers when it is themselves killing themselves.      I may not be in the situation these people live in.

I had to agree with some of their points, but in the end i chalked it up to personal preference, in that I prefer the feel of a classic revolver and that you use a .357 expecting kick and its a bit like a drop in a bucket in my opinion. Although the argument could be made that more kick would mean a reduction has a bigger impact, exponential even, but i also felt that the weight distribution would be of, with which people supplied the pictures of this chiappa design, so in the end i agreed that its a video game and not worth bickering about.

So many people don't know where the line is. You've already passed the hardest part. Your question is how to do it (though I think YellowOrbitz summed it up quite well)--  1. Let the co-worker know that it's been nice being friends, but you have to cut down on the relationship. This means no more talking outside of work, meeting for drinks, etc.  2. You reaffirm that you want to keep it strictly professional. Be friendly if she approaches you at work, but don't *engage* 3. Block co-workers number and social media. Out of sight, out of mind. The crush will disappear in no time.   Your co-worker may be hurt. Understandably so. Just remember that you have made the choice to prioritize your girlfriend and be glad with that choice. Use it to motivate you to keep to your word and not move forward with the co-worker.   Good luck!   Edit: A word, a sentence. ",,0,0,t3_34h6pz
