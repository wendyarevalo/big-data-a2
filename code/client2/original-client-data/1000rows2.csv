The largest minority in North America would probably be Hispanics, then Africans. Neither are on our side. In fact, Mexicans have a history of siding with whites against Asians, as shown in the Watsonville anti-Filipino riots, which escalated into a shootout between armed whites and armed Filipino farmworkers. Mexican farmworkers, instead showing solidarity with fellow oppressed laborers, picked up their rifles and joined with their white masters instead (I guess they favored the Spaniard rapist side of their heritage more than the native ""indio"" side). Needless to say, the Filipinos were overwhelmed. As for blacks, well, thats already been discussed. I did not say all this just to be a negative neener nanner. I just want to put it out there so there is a healthy dose of skepticism and caution regarding other minority groups. Should Hispanics become the dominant demographic, we still need to have our game face on. I'm saying this as a man who likes taco poon the most.  &gt;I truly understand that Asian men from Asia most likely China will have to take measures to make their culture and economic export enough to rival western societies or even break it.  They will have to yes, but do they even realize that they have to? My consumption of Asian media (movies, dramas, some news) shows me that Asian men in Asia are still ignorant of the racial-sexual politics, nor the benefits of controlling cultural ""soft power"" versus the detriment of not controlling it. FOB dudes I have spoken to back in school days are pretty ignorant of the concepts discussed here and their implications. And it's not because they are idiots or something, it's because they never had to face these things head on (until they live in the West long-term). China, while making strides economically and militarily, is still very lacking in PR and self-marketing. They have trouble defending military action in their own backyard, while America can have hundreds of bases around the world and still claim benevolence. I believe the subpar PR/marketing is cultural to Asia (modesty as virtue, depth&gt;perception, etc.) Just as we speak of a movement of Asian men in the west, it would take another cultural movement in Asia to raise awareness to the importance of cultural dominance, and to convince the men in power that they have a vested interest in exporting their culture on masculine terms. Remember, these men are already very very comfortable with where they are, either swimming in Asian pussy or content with how virtuously chaste they are , so it is gonna take one heck of a sweetass carrot to get them to lift a finger towards something as uncharted as cultural dominance over round-eyed people.",,1430461439,0,t1_cquoftk

Well... that goes to show how easy it is to misinterpret things online, eh?  I should be more careful about that. I apologize for reading you the wrong way. :)  I don't know what your experience your friends have had, and I am certainly in no position to judge another person's sobriety, but I can say that the time I've spent on this has led me to believe that addiction isn't so much about the substance as it is wanting to take that little vacation from reality.  I think this is true of /all/ addiction, not just alcohol addiction.  Including even, say, nicotine addiction.    When I go to the gym, I see a lot of people lifting all wrong.  Like that guy who lays down to bench press but only brings the bar halfway down. I'm not talking about the guy who does that for a reason (and there are valid reasons do to that) I'm talking about the guy who does it because all he cares about is progressing in weight and finds that it's easier to lift more weight if he doesn't care at all about form.  Hey, if that's good enough for him, good for him.  It's not good enough for me.    So, I guess what I'm saying is, I wouldn't personally spend a lot of time thinking about what other people can and can't do.  I don't know what sort of thoughts that person has about those other substances. It may well be that they have a problem but just don't know it yet, or that they're OK with having this problem as it pales in comparison to their other problem.     I don't know how those substances make that person feel.  When I think about using a drug, the main attraction, for me, is the escape. I'm assuming that they ""get"" to take those escapes, when, in reality, they never feel that way at all.   If this person can use without feeling that attraction, then we're talking apples and oranges anyway, ya know?  I'm comparing two things that can't be compared.   I know this much: For me, the best course of action is learning to not take that little break from reality.  Just like in the weight room. Other people can do whatever they want.  If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it right. And, for me, this is the only right way to do it.    ",,0,0,t1_cquqzev

You just need to find those people who are equally excited about the same things. I agree that maybe not that many will like to talk or are able to have conversations about topics such as writing and literature. Like I said, people with strong passions are probably going to have a hard time finding others who share their passions and can talk about something specific very profoundly. It's not easy to keep up with people like that. Some get pretty intense when they have a chance to discuss their favorite topic. Some people enjoy all kinds of interacting, small talk and just chatting around and for some it takes time to get to that deeper level of connection. Even if there's no immediate feeling of connecting with someone it does not mean it won't happen in time. Sometimes you need to move slow.  It's true that most people are at first a little uncomfortable in new situations with new people. Do you take special interest in individuals or are you socializing in groups? If you meet a nice person do you focus on them and ask them about their passions, ask if they wanna meet up again etc? It's very hard to guess what could be the reason for not getting pass the surface connections. Body language and many other things play a huge part when meeting new people. The balance of showing you're enjoying someones company but not pushing yourself at them is a tricky thing.  It does seem that you have very specific interests which affect you when meeting people. It's almost like there's two scenarios 1) situation where you feel that you have to play yourself down which is unsatisfying, and then feeling disconnected 2) situation where you are alone with your interests. Do you think this is the case?  Do you meet these other online friends? That one time with that one guy didn't end too well but there can be a million reasons for why he became absent. If you're not up for confronting him for that then you shouldn't think about it too much. It might have nothing to do with you afterall. It also doesn't sound to me like your speech problems would be the actual problem. Maybe try to trust your friends on this one? :)   Yeah, I too tend to write long posts.

For anybody else, it makes no difference -- if you can't *tell* when interfering is counter-indicated, which is true of human beings, we just have to make the best choices we can and hope for the best.

Why I was having a bad day doesn't matter, it was just one of those days that were kind of off.  My bartender was exceptionally busy, but was killing it. Everyone was being served quickly, and nobody was upset, and the bar was packed for a weekday during happy hour. I guess she saw that look in my eyes, because she motioned to get my attention and let me know that someone was leaving a stool at the other end of the bar.  While it stayed busy the entire time I was there, she took a few moments out to make chit chat. Asked if I was feeling okay, and offered some great uplifting words.  Now, I would overtip anyway just from years in the industry, but watching her serve a large crowd efficiently, and taking the time to talk to me, while keeping her bar spotless was impressive.

People have been saying that obesity is the worst thing for America for years, pretty much as long as I've been alive. The statistics may show an increasing number of obese, but statistics show whatever you want them to, not to mention that pre-90s we didn't even bother to take good measurements of such things, so all we are left with from such times are anecdotal pieces of evidence and guestimates.  Obesity certainly isn't good for you, but I don't entirely buy into it being a disease that is going to ravage the nation terribly. People thought the same thing of AIDS, and a million other diseases and disorders, and as we are developing more and more ways of making healthy food affordable I think we are going to see a decrease in obesity anyway.   Just as an aside, there's also good reason to question our very definition of overweight and obese. It's certainly possible to be healthy (or at least at an average level of health) while being above the recommended weight, and our ideas of what qualifies as  a healthy body weight hasn't changed in decades, despite medical understanding of the issues becoming vastly more complex.   In short, Obesity is something that I agree we should be informing people about, and certainly not encouraging but in the end it's a personal decision that IMO does not have the major effect on society that many fear.

As for the Visa requirements it is a night mare for anyone considering anything besides a tourist visa. I was required to get a missionary visa and I constantly received calls from the Police (Inquiries are mandatory for anyone staying longer than 180 days)   Living in India can be very rewarding but be prepared to see some very heart breaking moments as you see that in India you'll most likely be the rich guy and even if you aren't there will be many who will treat you like a bag of cash.

Effectively,  &gt;everything is going to be done in-transit and in-situ, and disk I/O  &gt;won't really be done until the very very end, on a much smaller &gt;already-processed subset of the original multi-petabyte dataset.  Agreed completely. In fact, one could argue that MapReduce as envisioned and implemented by google is a *great* example of co-design - by making paramount the economics of data processing at scale, and understanding that most of their (then) analytic operations were fundamentally decomposable, google came up with a restrictive programming model suited primarily to scaling, with all the attendant compromises. This model was designed for lots of commodity-based pizza boxes connected by a crappy network, with lots of spinning disk on node (or arguably vice-versa). this doesn't make it useless or primitive, any more than bacteria in undersea vents are less evolved than humans.  You have a point - I was using SQL illustratively. The thing I was going after was an increasing need for analytics, especially in hybrid workflows in HPC user bases - and awareness of the tradeoff between performance and productivity it is bringing into focus. To the extent that there are now tools (not the most performant ones, and Hadoop is a bad example, but Spark a far better one) that shorten the time to first *analytic* result, people will *begin* with those tools, especially since they are already existing ecosystems with communities, not priesthoods with initiation rituals. Yes, it would definitely be possible to hugely improve on these tools or design perfect ones without compromise. But the reality is, i'm working on one such use case with a 'proper' HPC customer who has made Spark a cornerstone of their analytic strategy, and know of several others doing the same - because they don't want to re-invent 40+ years of analytics technology, however perfectly.",,0,0,t1_cqppyh8

I can only think of two mechanisms that would allow a flying object to ""feel"" the movement of a distant object. Boundary Layer mechanics and Pressure Waves.  Boundary layers form whenever there is an object moving with respect to fluid, such as the atmosphere. A boundary layer is the area that the fluid flow is transitioning speed. At the top of a boundary layer, the flow is the speed of the free stream. At the bottom, the flow is the speed of the object.  A bird would feel the effect of the earth moving if it was inside the boundary layer caused by the motion of the ground. The size of the boundary layer depends on the speed of motion, and the length of the object. An air plane wing's boundary layer is measured in inches (centimeters), but the old zeppelins and airships could potentially create layers 6 feet tall (2 meters). People could walk inside them without being blown off.  The ground is big ^[citation ^needed] and earthquakes are fast. I can imagine a boundary layer the size of a small house forming in a violent earthquake.   ***If a bird was within 10 feet of the ground (3 meters), it Would feel a strong earthquake's boundary layer***  Pressure waves, however, are much larger, and have no travel restrictions. A pressure wave forms when a lot of air is displaced very quickly. An earthquake might be able to do this. This is outside my knowledge base but I bet strong earthquakes (8+ on Richter scale) could create pressure waves felt potentially miles away. Cannot confirm. Get an earthquake guy to figure out how much ground moves how quickly.  **Maybe pressure waves too. Would be a small number of strong bumps felt potentially a mile or two in the sky.

That's not any better.  Next, a tear 'gas' canister doesn't 'spark'. So the second guy is automatically a liar. To be fair though, they do get hot as hell towards the end, but to say that a huge fire started out of a public trash can is kind of crazy. Especially since those trash cans would have contained a fire started inside of it.  FYI- Tear gas is a solid, and 'burns' from the core out. The burning acts like a little jet, shooting the chemical out of the canister. The canister itself doesn't spark or flare up, that's all in the solid and doesn't leave the canister, unless someone's intentionally shaking it up I would guess.",,1430459300,0,t3_34g8k9

You're not pressured to believe anything you don't want to. And coming from a private school background, no, I don't think I can expect the same expectations one would have for a private school.

The first thing to keep in mind is that art is a discipline that can be just as complicated and technical as programming, and requires a variety specialized skills. This goes doubly so for 3D, but even in 2D you've still got a lot of different disciplines to cover if you're going to fill the art role by yourself-- it's not enough to draw something that looks good, it also has to look good in motion, so you'll need to learn to animate, and of course you'll need backgrounds and special effects and etc, etc. Lots of different skills involved.  I work much slower than a pro, and my art is more ""hobbyist"" quality than AAA, but I'm finally happy with my ability to translate from my imagination to reality. (If you want to take a look at some stuff, I've got an older image pinned on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/Jeckdev)-- though once I get time for gamedev again I should really post something newer...)  So, advice--   TL;DR version:  * Work around your limitations * Be satisfied with what you can do * Practice as much as you can  First, **acknowledge your limitations and find ways to work around them.**   For me, my biggest limitation is the super-fine motor skills and steady hand that traditionally trained artists have (though that's improved a little with time). I started out having trouble drawing a sphere at all, like you, and I still have trouble drawing a sphere without it occasionally looking squashed or squiggly.  So my solution was to find tools and workflows that didn't require those things. I work in 3D, doing sculpting in ZBrush (which is a lot like playing with clay), and I use layers and undo frequently.   *You might try something like vector art*, where you can set up shapes and colors without requiring the motor skills, or pixel art where you can zoom in and work one pixel at a time.  Secondly, **find a style that works for you, and be happy with it**. You're not gonna start from scratch and instantly be able to make graphics like [Heart Forth, Alicia](http://www.alonsomartin.mx/hfa/). So find something that hides the mistakes you make, hides the areas where you lack skill, and be happy with that. Don't just be happy, actually-- *take your limitations and own them*. So you can't do awesome hand drawn street fighter characters? Set your goal something like Atari 2600 graphics, and then make that your thing. Own it. Use all the modern tools and polish available to turn that limited style into a thing of careful beauty. I mean, check out [SanctuaryRPG,](http://sanctuaryrpg.com/) or [Black Ice](http://superdupergc.com/)-- these games completely own their art styles.  Lastly, **practice as much as you can**. This is the simple one, and should be obvious. Two years ago my attempts at art were terrible, misshapen doughy things that deserved to be put out of their misery. Now they're not. Keep at it and you can get there.  Now that I've said all that, though, I'd be remiss not to point something out: **Art takes time.** And learning to make art takes an even longer span of time.   **If what you really want is to make games, then just make games.** You don't need fancy art skills to do that-- you've seen [Thomas was Alone](http://www.mikebithellgames.com/thomaswasalone/), right? Learning to make art is rewarding as heck, but it's not gonna help you make a game any faster.  (PS-- Hopefully you don't mind the links, I just love the style of all those games. This is one of the reasons gamedev is so awesome-- seeing amazing stuff like that every day, from new talents and old pros.)",,1430526078,0,t3_34gko1

AOE Signature is a blast, great for bosses or just clearing trash, and it effectively has a 10 second cooldown, since it synergizes with her steroid. She lacks any damage mitigation, but her health regen is extremely good, and her playstyle encourages you to move around. Her spirit alternative means she can fully regen her pool from a handful of basic attacks, meaning you don't have to itemize for spirit regen, which is fantastic.   Psylocke, I played as a hybrid. I found her rotation very awkward by comparison, having to stealth every few seconds to get the damage bonuses from her skills. Her AOE is pretty weak. I enjoyed her implosion skill for clumping trash, but her signature is very underwhelming. Also, she's got damage mitigation, but essentially NO health regen, I died a lot more playing psylocke than playing X-23.

I was enrolled in AP Euro for the year, and from what I can remember, I bought the Barrons book and read/highlighted all of the chapters broken down chronologically, likely in the same order you've seen in class (might've skipped the modern material, but I'm not aware how much weight it carries on the actual exam). Takes about 1-2 hours for each chapter's information to solidify in your mind (maybe more maybe less), as well as follows with chapter-specific questions, to be done immediately after reading each. For straight memorization, I'd suggest creating a Quizlet of material you're struggling with. I started this process (before Quizlet was a thing) right before spring break, so then roughly a month before the exam. This far along I had begun taking the practice exams at the back, which thoroughly attunes you to the style of MCQs (if a bit harder, being Barrons) as long as you're in a quiet phone-less environment to do so. I'd honestly dispense with the Barrons free-response section and pull up the released AP DBQs and FRQs to be completed under the given time constraints. Not that Barrons aren't reflective of the test, but the scoring rubrics tend to be more extensive for the real deal; plus you can see hand-written student essays (after you've finished yours of course) and their grades for a particular question.",,0,0,t3_34hcw4

For the first time in my life there is a candidate running for one of the two major political parties that *actually* represents my views!

I've been telling my friends for the last couple of years, ""Wouldn't it be great if Sanders or Warren could be the next president?"" And now...Sanders is actually running!?   Yes, it is going to be one hell of an uphill battle. Yes, the money is in the other candidate's pocket. But I can honestly say this is the first democratic or republican presidential campaign I have been legitimately excited to get behind! And excitement is a major understatement - exhilarated, enlivened, electrified! There's a major political battle to be fought right now, and Bernie might be just the guy we need to fuel the necessary fire!   We all need to make sure this excitement does nothing but grow. We *all* need to talk to our friends, talk to our families, talk to our colleagues, get as educated on his stances as we possibly can, and keep yapping the facts until every damn person of voting age in the country knows the name Bernie Sanders!  Seriously people, to every single one of you that reads this, do me *one* favor *right now* - tell your parents and your siblings about this! Whether that be a Facebook message, an email, a text message, or consecutive phone calls, don't wait one minute. Get the word to at *least* those people immediately, and tell them you need them - we *all* need them - to get to the primary elections to vote for Bernie.

But it's mostly been about how to use their weaponry more effectively and how to maximize their load outs, then actual gameplay (radar, leading targets, that sorta shit). Thing is, actually joining them in-game would do absolutely nothing to help them out - watching them stream and giving time based notations on their actual game is imo much more effective as they can learn exactly when they could've done something better and try put it into actual practice in future.

His brother is a  cautious man, a reasoned man, subtle, deliberate, even indolent to a degree. He is a man who  weighs the consequences of every word and every action. But Oberyn has always been half- mad.”      “Is it true he tried to raise Dorne for Viserys?”      “No one speaks of it, but yes. Ravens flew and riders rode, with what secret messages I never  knew. Jon Arryn sailed to Sunspear to return Prince Lewyn’s bones, sat down with Prince Doran and ended all the talk of war. But Robert never went to Dorne thereafter, and Prince Oberyn  seldom left it.”   and in the same chapter:  &gt;  “Oberyn knows that Gregor was the one who...”      “He knows nothing. He has heard tales. Stable gossip and kitchen calumnies. He has no crumb  of proof. Ser Gregor is certainly not about to confess to him. I mean to keep him well away for  so long as the Dornishmen are in King’s Landing.”      “And when Oberyn demands the justice he’s come for?”      “I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children,” Lord Tywin said calmly.  “So will you, if he asks.”      “Ser Amory Lorch is dead,” Tyrion said flatly.      “Precisely. Vargo Hoat had Ser Amory torn apart by a bear after the fall of Harrenhal. That  ought to be sufficiently grisly to appease even Oberyn Martell.”   ",,1430459332,0,t1_cqur4mv

A fighting game for example will require learning the movesets of each character and how to recognize attacks, learning which of your character's moves counter each of your opponent's moves, and developing the reflexes to recognize a move based on its animation as it activates and respond with your counter in the split second between the opponent's move activating and the opponent's move connecting.  In a real-time strategy game it's often about learning different 'build orders', which is to say which units/structures to build and in which order, and often you'll need to learn multiple build orders based on who you're playing against. Your army will likely benefit from a different optimal build order against an enemy army that specializes in infantry than it would against an enemy army that specializes in tanks, for example. These types of games also require learning hotkeys, and other tricks that allow you to shave every second you can off of how long it takes you to do things. Like the fighting games above, reflexes are important.  Maybe your reflexes stink (I know mine do) and you want a game that doesn't require you to be able to react in a tenth of a second to master it. Maybe you're playing a turn-based strategy of some kind. Like the real-time strategy above, learning things like build orders and which things counter which opponents is very important in these games, and since you can't beat your opponent with superior reflexes, your strategy and knowlege of the game's mechanics becomes even more important.  ...Well, these are all just nonspecific examples.

I would HIGHLY recommend that you try and completely mimic these tracks. You will learn so much from doing this! Only once you've really mastered copying would I recommend creating original tracks.

I'll remain optimistic that they've learned their lessons after this past year.

Can you talk to your doctor or midwife about what you've seen and tell them about your fears about it? Theyll be able to discuss with you and hopefully put your mind at rest, your mental state is just as important as your physical for a smooth pregnancy and birth and any provider worth their salt should be happy to invest some time allaying fears now in order to have a happier mama (and therefore much easier patient). Who will be with you at the birth? Talk to them too and make sure they know what you want and don't want and what you will need reassurance about during labour.   Know that it is totally possible to have a relaxed, wonderful birth too. We talk a lot more about the dramatic bits than the mundane, and everybody wants to tell you how awful and painful and stressful it was. I had my first baby on Sunday, not gonna lie it did hurt, but not so much that I needed pain relief to cope, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I do have a high pain threshold, but I have seen women give birth who have hardly any tolerance for pain at all and the only difference is that they complained more about it and needed more pain relief.

Terrified. I could feel it's fear. It overcame me. I shot bolt upright and gasped for air. Something was wrong. I didn't know where or with who, but something was wrong, and someone, or something, had reached out for help. I called or texted everyone I cared about right then, begging them to let me know they were safe. I didn't sleep until I had heard replies from all of them. I'm in tears right now writing this because I haven't quite processed the experience yet. It was so raw, and at the pit of it all, I feel like maybe there was a way I could have helped. Maybe I could have done something. Maybe it was someone I had failed to remember to check in with, someone who had remembered me in their moment of desperation.

Also, getting adequate exercise greatly reduces one's likelihood of getting diabetes, regardless of weight, and helps to control diabetes if you already have it. Other things you listed are really just potential complications and/or symptoms of health issues that are already listed (leg ulcers, macular degeneration, infertility, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, snoring). Varicose veins are both genetic and a lifestyle issue caused by standing in place too much. Gout is caused by certain types of food, which also happen to be higher in calories. Hernias are more likely if you have poor abdominal muscle tone. Joint and muscle pain CAN be exacerbated by obesity, but even that one they are not sure it's the cause, since people who have these issues also tend to have problems in non-weight bearing joints as well.   What I'm saying is that while many conditions are associated with obesity, there is little evidence that they are actually CAUSED by obesity. Bipolar disorder also associates strongly with obesity. It's not because obesity causes bipolar, it's because the vast majority of medications for bipolar disorder cause most people to gain weight.   ",,0,0,t1_cqur0v8

No, because meaning is bestowed on things by us. Sure, we can convince people that they should accept the same meaning as us, whether it's a spouse convincing their partner to keep something or something as large scale as a religion, but existence begins and ends with you, as far as you'll ever be able to experience.

An advanced tech he has for comboing is called ASC, which stands for aura sphere canceling.  This is what it looks like.  https://gfycat.com/HospitableAshamedDromedary  Do you see where he charges his aura sphere, and then cancels it?  That is ASC.  Basically, you can cut the endlag of any move down to 14(I think) frames by canceling into AS, then canceling it with shield.

That before 1964, Asians simply weren't allowed to emigrate into the US due to immigration policy. And after 1964, Asian immigrants were largely from academic and scientific backgrounds.  After 1964, the vast majority of Asian immigrants were selected to enter the country SPECIFICALLY for their academic abilities. At this point the US wanted to win the Cold War and was basically importing scientists, engineers, and other academic types from Asian countries. This is also the major cause of ""brain drain"" from places like China . The OP is absolutely right that many of these people came to the US with the clothes on their backs. But many also came with educations or specifically to become educated.  Success of certain minority groups is NOT JUST BECAUSE OF CULTURE OR MENTALITY. Many Asian immigrant groups that were NOT from this group (mostly refugees), are seeing the SAME economic struggles that late-generation blacks are seeing in the US. ",,0,0,t1_cqtzmoj

Since you'd be more comfortable with explicit rules, I'd advise you to avoid GMs that have a large number of ""houserules"" or are running a ""homebrew"" game. That doesn't mean they *aren't* good GMs by any means, but typically speaking the ""most"" immutable rpg games are those that follow the ""standard"" core rules, simply because the core rules are kind of like ""official"" rules like that of the NBA association. You'll know beforehand that rolling a 10 against X *will* do Y, and can point to the rules to prove it.  ;D  A word of caution: despite knowing the rules beforehand, that doesn't mean that *everything* you do will be automatically accepted.

The opponents all over world and not in Europe had by 2010-11 adapted to Barca, which is what makes the 2011 the peak of the club in the history of the club.    The oppnents were fully aware they had 0 chance and hence reacted to that with the strategies that Pep faced.   The team did in fact get worse post Pep, this is undisputed. Losing Abidal, Puyol and not signing any replacement is the reason we lost 2 Liga titles.",,1430486048,0,t1_cquccjb
