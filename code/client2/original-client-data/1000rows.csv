She comes home from school feeling all fucked up and her roommate takes her to the doctor. Doctor says that he thinks she's on some kind of drug and asked if  she took anything that day. She tells the doctor about what happened in school.  Well, police are called. A few days later the cops ask her to go to the teacher and ask for a few more. She does and he gives her some more. She brings it to them. IIRC it ended up being some really strong pain killers. Cops get the school involved and teacher was fired immediately.

Here's [mine](https://github.com/aihal/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.zshrc), that said mine isn't exactly a paragon of clarity and a few things (especially in the completion style declarations, i stole those many years ago from the grml zsh config) might be unoptimized. But overall i'm pretty happy with it. You might get some nice ideas and a general feel for zsh configuring from it. There's tons of others as well of course, i suppose searching in github for zshrc will give you a lot of results.  There's also those 'frameworks'. I'm not too big a fan of them but they're very popular, like oh-my-zsh and whatever.

And you're on a low tier server like Ferg's Crossing or Borlis Pass or something like that, and can't find anything to do during NA prime time. Am I understanding you here?  Also let me preface this with a friendly reminder that server doesn't matter for anything but WvW, so if you don't WvW you should save your money and avoid taking up space on a WvW centric server.  Also I typed this all on my phone so I'm sure there are a lot of typos and lazy grammatical mistakes but I'm sure you'll forgive me.  Assuming you're talking about NA prime time, as in 7pm eastern time to 12pm eastern time, my answer to you would be DON'T. Those are all T1 servers and they are all likely queued on every map/most maps during NA prime. Those queues can get nasty as well, and they'll only get bigger as we get closer to HoT's release. Additionally, T1 is an absolute blobfest so don't plan on zergbusting or solo roaming effectively.  T2 servers (known henceforth as Fort Asshole, Yak's Bendover, and Sea of Salt) is also overcrowded, especially FA. Expect queues and blobs, *but* there are (were*, several transferred out) a lot of fight guilds in T2 so there are GvGs and stuff going on pretty often. It should also be pretty stable since  FA unstacked a little bit, and Maguuma finished off the 4th T2 server that was preventing the tier from stabilizing. But seriously, there's a lot of blobbing, map queuing, and open field siege in this tier, and I would avoid it unless there's a specific guild you wish to join. Even then I'd think hard before wasting that much gold or gems.  T3 (Maguuma/""Swaguuma"", Stormbluff Isle/""Stormblob Isle"", Dragonbrand/""Dragonsbend"") might be your best bet. HOWEVER, don't go to DB. The server is dead, it has virtually no NA, and the only reason they aren't ticking 0 every hour of every day is because they have a ton of asians that flip everything while the other servers sleep. Not ideal for an NA player unless 4am-10am is your preferred time slot. They're dropping in the ranks fast though and should be replaced by HoD, the latest bandwagon server of choice, within a few weeks. It's worth mentioning that most of DB's NA went to HoD during the great server exodus of 2015 a couple weeks ago, and they now queue all maps 30+ on reset apparently which is absolutely insane, Mag is the highest ranked T3 server by a comfortable margin, almost at risk of rolling into T2, and we don't even queue all 4 maps on reset. In all honesty I don't think HoD will be the powerhouse that some people claim as they should be beating CD by a much larger margin. If they play like that in T3 they won't be here long.  T4 isn't bad. Nothing really standout about it though. Same with T5. If you decide to go to this level, I'd recommend Darkhaven, Crystal Desert, and Ehmry Bay in order of most busy to slightly less busy. Lots going on during NA prime at all of these servers though, just avoid Isle of Janthir as they're very unstable at the moment and just generally in the process of dying.  Anyways TL;DR: Don't go T1, try not to go T2, maybe go T3, if you don't go T3 go T4/5. SBI likes transfers (I'm not even on SBI I just know they want even more people)",,1430459282,0,t3_34heae

Senior year of high school I recognized Paranoid Android as the masterpiece it is, but that's it. I remember trying to listen to The Bends and In Rainbows and something about it just didn't appeal to me.  Well, freshman year of college (now coming to an end), I was on crew for a show my school was putting on. Now, in this show, no set pieces moved, so I had nothing to do. So I sat backstage playing FTL. On a whim, I loaded the full album of The Bends on Youtube and absolutely loved it. I subsequently listened to In Rainbows, Kid A, OK Computer, all the rest.

Don't get me wrong there are tons and tons  of amazing Android apps, but the garbage outnumbers the gold if you ask me.  In the case of Android's back button, in my opinion it's kind of a poor design to have two places to go back, when the user of the phone is most likely already used to the concept that back is in the bottom left (or wherever it is on your particular android device).  This becomes an even bigger concern when you're merging menus and cutting functionality from your menus due to screen real estate. Having a back button prevents you from adding an otherwise crucial button function.",,0,0,t1_cqupp6b

Some weapons have special attacks and some spells look like special attacks, but you probably don't really have to worry about that if you're going with a physical damage build. Your covenant is the Way of Blue covenant, which you join by talking to the depressed-sounding knight in Majula, whose only purpose is to summon people (from the Blue Sentinels covenant) to help you when someone invades your world. The game probably summoned someone to help you out and he back stabbed the invader, different weapons have different backstab animations and the one for the lances looks like what you described.  You can learn a lot about the game from the wiki I linked. The beauty of the Souls series is that you learn as much as you want. If you want to casually stroll through the game without a care in the world, with enough persistence and by summoning people to help you probably can do just fine. On the other hand if you want to fully explore a beautifully crafted world, learn all the intricacies of the lore and learn all the gameplay tricks you'll probably spend hundreds of hours doing so.

You could fix this by setting your CAM to an advanced playmaker position with a support duty, and consider swapping one of your wings to either IF(S) or Winger (S), preferably on the side with a better crossing stat. This will allow the midfield to play the ball forward easier into your attacking third. That solves part of the issue. You could also switch one of your midfielders to box to box, which will help him connect with your defense. Your new supporting winger will also do the same.  You give some odd instructions, too. You instruct your players to exploit the flanks, but you have an inside forward and a raumdeuter. Both of those positions tend to drift inwards on the pitch naturally as part of their game. By issuing a exploit the flanks shout, you're basically halving the effect of both the player and the shout, because now they're not going to drift as far center as they normally would, but still not be as close to the flank as you'd like them to be. Your fullbacks suffer a similar issue, they're not naturally very wide players.  Direct passing and play out of defense seem to counter one another, also. Which do you want them to do? Take long, direct passes, or dribble/short pass out of defense?  [Here is my take on the formation.](http://i.imgur.com/yG9dMmr.jpg)",,0,0,t3_34gh7l

Against LVs this can be very difficult to do (due to enemy 4-push), but you should really try to mitigate their early xp lead as much as possible. * You can also allow a lane to be pushed to your gate, thus making the LV overextend to keep soaking, and then you can jump them.

I started out playing Blingtron/Harrison/Water Ele mech mage and Facehunter and then switched to midrange zoo around rank 5. I'm trying to really think about my plays and push my winrate up, so I have a chance of actually getting to legend with a reasonable number of games. I think I'll start out playing zoo and change things around as we see how the meta pans out this season.  I'm excited to have a supportive community to be a part of this month and hope that lots of others join in as well :-)  UPDATE as of May 5th: I'm at rank 9 now. I've mostly been playing Bloodyface's Patron Warrior deck. He has a great guide with mulligan info in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/34qa4k/finished_3_legend_na_last_season_with_grim_patron/). I messed around with midrange zoo, Dragon Warrior, and Spectral Knight double-combo Druid from ranks 16 to 15. Then I switched over to this deck to actually climb and currently have gone [19 wins and 6 losses](http://prntscr.com/721d7i) with it. As long as you get your weapons early, it does quite well against mech/flamewaker mage and zoo, which are well-represented on ladder right now.   UPDATE as of May 12th: I'm at rank 7 now. I hadn't had a lot of time to climb over the last week, but I caught the podcast live on twitch and was inspired to try out [one of the Tempo Mage decks talked about on the show](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/227207-eu-legend-1-tempo-mage-updated). I'm still learning the deck and definitely misplayed against a Handlock right off the bat, but I ended up going [11 wins/4 losses](http://prntscr.com/74aagq) with it, so I feel pretty good about that. It was really fun to play too. I got Neptulon and Gallywix off some of the first few portals, which were both huge tempo swings in their respective games.   UPDATE as of May 19th: Rank 4 now. I spent a chunk of time messing around with Dragon Druid, which was pretty great for a couple days and took me to rank 4, but then I ran into more Zoo and fell to rank 5. I just switched over to Demon Zoo and climbed back to rank 4. My overall win-rate for the month is 56.9%, so I'm feeling alright about how things are progressing.",,1432038797,0,t3_34f5mc

But then I got to thinking, there's not an easy way that I know of to steal virtual finances, even with time frozen. And I'd have 24 hours to find as good a source of money as I could. But, it's not like banks are likely to have tons of cash just sitting around for a frozen-time thief to steal (is it?) Plus, banks store people's money. If I were to clean out a bank, it'd affect the people trusting their money to that bank as well.  The next most available source of cash is people around me, my family and neighbors and friends. But A: I'd feel like a total dick for stealing from them and B: I could totally do that in real time if I desperately wanted to. So that's out.  I could find some total strangers and snag their wallets, but still, I don't want to be a complete dick. How do I know that this person isn't really struggling, and that the $100 in their wallet isn't all they have to get them through the week? If I suddenly found all my cash gone, it'd sure make me upset.  I could rob some stores, but that'll probably end with some poor cashier getting fired for fucking up the cash count. Not gonna be a dick here.  Maybe smash some ATMs? I can't think how much of a negative effect that would have, short of the company having to pay repair or replacement costs. But really, that's my best option, as far as I can tell.  At the end of the day, I don't want to be a dick. So, I'd probably resort to my second instinct: Lift a few skirts, look down a few shirts.

While being married a husband must keep up his wife by giving her money and making sure she has clothing and other nice things. He cannot be hurtful to her. A man cannot have sex with his wife unless she is willing and also she has menstruated or has grown hair on her sex.

A couple things about this sentence... 1. You'd rather see someone with passion and no clue how to run a league run the tf2 league than the people that know exactly how to run a league (and have been running a league for 18 seasons, including 16 tf2 seasons)? 2. No one is able to do this. Contrary to popular belief, no one that would be anywhere near qualified to do this would want to do it. Because everyone qualified will come up with the same logical thought: what I'm able to accomplish- passion or not- will not be as good as the league that's been doing this for 6 years.  &gt;I wish Team fortress tv, or extine would make a league all their own.  TF.TV intends to be a source for competitive tf2, but they will not have a league so long as esea is running tf2, I guarantee it.  &gt; I don't want it to be in the hands of someone who authorized bitcoin mining on his cs clients and someone who was abandoning us at the worst time only to change their mind right when tf2's potential is out there.  Literally everyone who actually plays the game has moved on past the bitcoin fiasco. That was a year+ ago. Also, it was shared DURING LAST LAN BEFORE THE MATCHMAKING CAME UP that esea would have a tf2 lan piggy backing off of the cs:go one until the cs lan was moved to a ""real"" venue. When ESEA was offered **1 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR** to host it in a bigger venue, they did just that.  ESEA (and lpkane in particular) has a soft spot for tf2. Aside from it making their league not cs-specific, it is just a solid game competitively. ESEA recognizes this, and will keep it on their league list until the numbers get so low that it's not worth the effort.  I appreciate that you have an opinion on this, but it seems (to me at least) to be a very misinformed one. Time and time again, people try to break away from ESEA as the primary league for tf2.

You also read a lot of book reviews so you usually have a sense if a book is worth reading, and you further just know people in your field and their reputations and sometimes even their adviser's reputations. My dad's an academic as well and he likes to read our discipline's ""book review only"" journal because ""it lets him feel like he's read books he'll never get the chance to read."" And you specialize. If you do Roman economy, you might know very little about (and spend no money buying books on) the Roman military or the Greek economy. You often get from the library books more tangential to your field or that you know are of relatively minor importance.   But even still, yes, you buy a lot of books--more books than you'll ever have the chance to read. Classics you buy used for cheap (which ultimately only encourages you to buy more of them). That's one of the big differences as you move from the hard sciences to the humanities: my friend who did academic chemistry was like, ""oh, you never cite back further than the last annual review--everything is very new"". In history, information often doesn't get outdated quite as quickly so, for example, I have been working on a paper that's engaging a group of books published in the early 1980's that are all cheap used on Amazon (plus a handful of more recent books I had to buy mostly new). I was asking a colleague (an Ottomanist, whereas my thesis is on modern Turkey) about the best place to learn about internal migration in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to the city of Adana, and was like, ""Well, there are a few more recent books, but all you really have to read is this one thesis from 1981 that was never turned into a book because the guy who wrote it left academia to work for the IRS in San Fransisco because his adviser sort of screwed him over on the job market."" In the physical sciences, it would be very rare indeed for someone to recommend an unpublished dissertation written in the year they were born as being a sufficient introduction. ",,0,0,t1_cqug376

With this information I was able to dig up an [article that tries to explain how yellow light can influence focus accuracy](http://ricehigh.blogspot.com/2007/02/af-accuracys-dependency-on-lenses-and.html). According to the article,  &gt; The problem with the Pentax SAFOX VIII used in their DSLRs is that the AF system cannot see the focus in a WYSIWYG (""What You See Is What You Get"") way. That means that either 1. the optical path in the AF detection system is not resembled close enough to the optical path for the actual image formation (of which the AF path is comprised of various micro-mirrors and micro-lenses, and micro-splitprisms, for which the splitted images are ultimately projected onto the pair(s) of AF sensors , and/or, 2. the AF light sensitive sensor cannot cater for different wavelength as the light spectrum varies which causes the yellow light symptom with obvious FF as a result, say, the sensor may have a peak spectra response for the daylight only (usually peak response for green light for the CIE standard), but not for the yellow or red lights. But unfortunately, there is no adjustment mechanism in the SAFOX VIII design to minimize such deviations so as to improve the accuracy and reliability of the design.  From this I deduce that an accurately placed AF sensor would cause no problems, but as soon as one is misaligned the focus compensation algorithm should take the different wavelengths into consideration in its calculations.",,0,0,t1_cqunrke

American Pharoah had him beat and he wasn't going to catch him but AP isn't going to get that kind of set up Saturday.

If Firing Line gets to the lead like I think he will breaking out of the #10 and nobody pushes him much and he's just allowed the to lope along, he's dangerous.

When the party rogue has the moral high ground on you... you've probably gone straight to evil.  I would recommended discussing alternate XP systems.  Things that are no threat should grant no XP.  A much better system would be to grant total up the XP value of every monster in an encounter and awarding it to the party no matter how the encounter is cleared.  It discouraged the ""must murder everything"" option.  If you give a player 0 XP for talking a group of bandits down, they will pick the more rewarding option of killing them.  If scaring the bandits off gives full XP, it becomes a real option again.  I think this is ultimately something you want to handle out of game.  It is more of a dickbag player issue than a character issue.

I spent 15 bucks. (RDA was 10, atomizer head was 5).  I took the [atomizer](http://imgur.com/K1Wuldi) apart (you need to pull out the pin at bottom, unhook the wires, and then pull the coils out carefully, so you don't break the wicks or the wire.)  I took the coils and placed them alongside the wall on one side of the well, right where the wall meets the bottom of the well. Like so:  http://imgur.com/geZUteR  (Sorry about bad photoshop, but my phone's dead and it took my pictures with it)  The idea behind this is to have a well bigger than those available so far. Also, there are no holes at the bottom for my melted wax to run through and get wasted inside the atomizer.  I dropped a few crumbles on the coils and hit the fire button for a couple of seconds to melt it and soak the wicks. I placed the inner ring with the vents away from the side with the coils and left one vent open on each side. I took a hit and tasted great. Some wax made it to the bottom, so I let it harden (2 minutes in the freezer) and then pushed the coils down as far as I could. The hardened wax kept them from touching the bottom. I used an ileaf istick at 10 watts and he coils were 1.3 ohms.  A word of advice:  Some people like to pack their bowls. No this one. The coils are so low, it could short. Use a regulated battery only.  RDA comes with replacement gaskets, replacement screws, an Allen wrench, cotton and wire.",,0,0,t3_34hir1
