Making a general claim about the effect of one factor on another, does not help us agree on a value. We need to quantify how much decentralization will be sacrificed by a certain amount of tx data, and much we are willing to give up, otherwise we have no basis to judge whether the block size limit should be 1 KB, 1 MB, or 1 GB.  The other factors affected by larger blocks also need to be taken into consideration. For one, it can allow more people to use Bitcoin, which increases the number of people with an economic stake in the network, and economic incentive to run a fully validating node. Right now, 5,000 people out of 7,000,000,000 run a full node, because the portion of the world population with an economic stake in the network is so low. In this respect, the block size limit, that limits participation in the Bitcoin network, harms decentralization.  ",,1433117143,0,t1_crr91xj

I gave my baby up when I was 16. She only recently found me and we are in the process of reunion. I love her with everything inside me, but it is still the hardest thig I've ever done. My daughter had excellent parents who she loves very much, she was raised knowing she was adopted, her parents sent me photos and letters for several years, for which I was very grateful.  I raised all of my children from my later marriage knowing all about her and when she found me, they accepted her as part of the family immediately. Our adoption was a successful one. I used a social service agency, if you're in the USA, I would recommend you go that route. They are professionals with extensive experience, I would still recommend you get an attorney once you have made a connection with a social service. The adopting family will typically cover the expense of your attorney as well as any medical expenses. I didn't have an attorney and when adoption laws in my state changed a few years into my partial open adoption, I was left with no idea how to proceed. Later, when my daughter wanted her records, she was unable to get them because I was uninformed  on the front end, on how to be sure she could reach me. Even though this is a story with the best ending I could have hoped for, this  is still the most painful thing I have ever managed. Managing an adoption requires you to develop serious compartmentalizations skills. I cried every year on her birthday and on many Christmas eve's. I never allowed myself to let my grief ruin my life, but it was tempting.  Once my situation changed I could be with her, I have had to release all of that control and be flexible enough to build a relationship with this woman that I love so dearly, but barely know. It's a tall order. I'm doing my best, my daughter is doing her best, neither one of us could ask for more.  I wish you peace of mind and a strong heart. Feel free to ask me anything. ",,0,0,t3_380g6i

You can also be super cheap and have sketchy shops install Chinese parts from Ebay, but then don't expect reliability.

Can you give me the exact measurements (preferably by weight) of all of the ingredients you use? 2. Can you tell me how you knead the dough?  I make ""normal"" egg pasta quite often, and when I do I find it's very important to really knead the dough enough. You don't *need* to knead it that much, but I find the pasta to be firmer and chewier and more to my liking if I take the extra effort and sweat (gross) and really work the dough before I let it rest. I'm wondering if the same is true for ramen, or if it's a preference thing. I realize that working the dough really helps to develop the gluten and elasticity of the dough when I roll it out.

They may disregard simple commands from an officer, they may resist arrest, they may not be able to consider the consequences of their actions. They can be highly dangerous with or without a weapon.  The police were called because these criminals were already doing something that is not normal or lawful and were likely already disregarding the commands of other people on the scene.   Also, before you begin the argument of using deescalation tactics... having worked in a psychiatric hospital, a treatment center, and a psychiatric rehab facility, I can tell you that deescalation doesn't always happen the way you want it to...even with medications designed to subdue someone who is out of control.  I've seen 15 year olds in full blown crisis for 3 hours after medications were administered. I was seriously hurt by a 14 year old who was also given medications.  Sometimes, there isn't anything anyone can do to deescalate the situation, especially in an unpredictable environment. Considering the places I've worked are slightly more controlled than the streets, I can absolutely understand how officers would fear for their lives. They also have to consider what would happen if that person did not deescalate and continued to harm people. We would be asking why they didn't do something sooner if that were the case.

I kind of like her current poke and pressure playstyle, but she just isn't very good at anything and after a while nobody needs to fear your poke. Her shield and damage mitigation are cool and I suppose if she kept any part of her current kit I would want it to be her general tankiness. I *really* don't want her to end up just another burst mage with some shadowy decorations. The perfect result for me personally would be that she ends up more mobile with relatively low sustained damage, and she either keeps her tankiness or gets some healing in its place.   Fighting her  directly should feel futile like chasing a shadow should be, but she's more just a thing to be feared rather than a true threat. If you let your guard down around her she should be able to punish you for it, but she's shouldn't be like Poseidon or other big AoE burst mages where they can zone out a whole team or get multiple kills at a time with a well place nuke. I guess in short, I want playing against a Nox to give you the same kind of feeling you get when you're in the jungle alone at low health and you hear a Loki invis. Of course, none of that is at all specific about what I'd like in her kit, but I honestly don't care about specific abilities so long as her playstyle is fun, unique, and fits the darkness/night/terror theme.",,0,0,t3_37zs1r

Second Empire is talked about a lot, I've never been but you can meet the Chef and be fancy.  The Babylon Restaurant is an upscale Moroccan restaurant with an awesome patio. In Old Cary check out Serendipity (sp?) it's a sandwich joint and the hot dog place on the corner that's an old style drug store (name is drawing a blank but you can't miss it). Cary is a great place that everyone seems to relocate to, have met a lot of Northerners there as well.  For burgers check out Bad Daddy's or Chucks, for chicken and waffles you need to go to Beasley's or Dame's in Durham.  Durham is a separate beast with food and entertainment and it's not too far either, 30 minutes highway time if that. ",,0,0,t3_377wse
