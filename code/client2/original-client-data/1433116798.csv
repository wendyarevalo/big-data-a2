Also, every primal would like to have a word with you. Finishing a cast before your forced to move is a HUGE dps gain. For example, I can fit a hardcast fire three in LEX when he goes to slam down on the boat. That is a direct result of me accumulating so much spell speed. That hardcast fire three is amazing and it allows me to save my swift cast for a fast flare on the adds. I think you are being willfully ignorant if you think SS is only for gaining an extra cast after X amount of casts.   So every single long discussion out there is lying and they aren't basing SS stat weight on the extra casts, but a secret numerical base of one person. Sounds about right.   You keep missing the point, you're gaining ~100ms (0.1 seconds) over someone with balanced secondary stats, you're assuming every single EX primal fight you would have got hit if your cast time was 2.4 but you will be safe with a 2.3 cast time, that's simply unrealistic if not straight false. Speed does have benefits for some scenarios, like WAR and 9-hit in berserk, I'm not saying the only benefit of SS is the extra cast, but the extra cast is the main reason why SS weights a bit higher than the others. But this is not a generic debate about SS vs crit, the topic at hand is speed running dungeons, most of the time spent in a dungeon is getting rid of trash, not boss fights.   &gt;So, your entire argument is not about function but about inflating your meters? If trash dies within 2-3 flares, it really does not matter how powerful your flares are. I rather kill the bosses faster instead of worrying about overkill dps on trash.   No one is talking about meters, I'm talking about whether trash dies in 3 flares or 2, SS can't influence this, crit/det can.   &gt;Nope, don't make assumptions. I don't blindly follow anything. I actually raided with puro for over 9 months and we would talk about stats more than what was on his spreadsheet. &gt;You are making a fool of yourself at this point by basing your argument off of assumptions. You don't know me, or know how I play. I have five different gear sets on my Blm to itemize for different things. But please, go on and make your hurr durr raider argument and just assume I only have one set of gear that is outfitted for t13. You're adorable!  So if you have 5 different gearsets you DO know there isn't a perfect, unique BiS, then why the hell are you arguing there is? Don't you see your own contradiction?   &gt;I guess this makes you clearly wrong since you made so many assumptions about me =p Call yourself out first on making assumptions before you sink in your sea of generalities and half truths.  You're not proving me wrong with what I said above. ",,0,0,t1_crr9hzf
