Normally Sniper Rifles fall into your special weapon slot, but No Land Beyond is special in that it takes up your primary weapon. Also, you're only allowed two Exotic items to be equipped at once.  At first glance, this sounds wonderful, able to use a Sniper Rifle constantly without scrounging for Special Ammo, at the small price of not using a different exotic. It also looks pretty cool, it's an old wooden bolt action with some unique iron sights instead of a scope.  So of course you're all hyped to take your new exotic into PvP, and do some oxymoronic CQB sniping. With all this hype you forget to check the stats of the gun.   It's range? Fucking phenomenal, you'll never experience any form of damage drop off. Its fire rate is pretty expected since it's a bolt action instead of the normal Semi-auto you're used to in the game, but then you look at the impact. Impact is essentially your damage per shot, pay no attention to big numbers next to ""Attack"" your impact stat is where all the heavy lifting really happens. And of course Bungie gave the slow firing, non scoped, slow reload, Sniper, the normal amount of impact.   Now I know what you're thinking ""/u/l3esitos, what do you mean? Wouldn't extra impact be too OP?"" And normally, I'd say yes. But in the case of the No Land Beyond, it takes two shots to the body, or one to the head (normal for snipers in this game) but the fact that it fires so god damn slow, you better be ready to get fucking shit on while you're chambering the next round.   The meaning of the name is supposed to be about its range, but from what I've taken from it, it really means there's no land beyond that this will ever be a viable weapon.  ",,0,0,t1_crr9s6n

Please be aware that this is a ridiculously inadequate summing up of an incredibly complex conflict. You need to understand the NI dispute and the history of British intervention in Ireland, and Irish immigration to the UK post-1840 to have a hope of understanding the roots of the Old Firm.   The Scottish/Protestant community was represented by Rangers (not ""The"" Rangers unless you're a Celtic fan and dedicated WUM), the Irish/Catholics by Celtic. This rivalry manifested itself in pretty horrendous violence especially after 1950. My girlfriend's mam was a police surgeon in Ibrox in the 80s and said it was horrendous on match days. Even to this day my girlfriend won't have anything to do with football because of the toxicity associated with it in her mind.   Rangers went under for a range of financial troubles which most people ascribe to then chairman Craig Whyte who I believe is still on the run somewhere. Again, hugely complicated which is why a Wiki article won't tell you everything. They then reformed as Rangers NewCo and have been fighting their way up from the Scottish Third Division (now League 2?) ever since.   The Old Firm is specifically marked by sectarianism - the fans have names for each other based in ethnicity, songs get sung about the IRA/the British, and so on. It gets to the point where fans are dragging politics into football and vice versa - there was a  somewhat violent rally of Rangers Unionist fans after the No vote on independence in Glasgow last year. That's why it has a reputation as such a fierce and bitter rivalry. ",,0,0,t3_380lun

I'd really like to start an official culture here in TRP where we point this stuff out ('hate speech', 'rape culture' and the like) and call it what it is.

If at one point something did not exist and at another point did exist that at some point it must have been created. Rather we might say that something must have happened that moved it from non being to being. Nothing can make it self exist so everything that exists either has always existed or something else has caused it to come into being.   That's Aristotle mostly, I think the first mover argument is fantastic and rather hard to dismiss. It turns on the point that nothing can cause itself to be. The fact that things are means that there was something that never had a cause, something that simply existed. This thing is not necessarily ""God"",  Thomas says that this is what some people call God. 1",,0,0,t1_crr4a6r

Rinse and repeat.  ## Lifeline  This is a new story mode as told from the perspective of the army on a brand new map in a city. Much more fast paced than vanilla as you're tying to save key individuals, and being in the middle of a city, aka high population density, you will have to endure multiple zed sieges. Multiple endings.   ### Other  The other feature of note is that the game has been synchronized across the three games, meaning that all new weapons, vehicles, freaks, and mechanics introduced in the two DLCs have been added to every game type. The most important feature change is that cars have trunk space and resource backpacks can be dropped off just by parking at your base. ",,0,0,t3_380cyp

Funny enough, the site you cite for your rather lofty definition of slavery is the exact site that I linked [showing it is permissible to use your female slaves as fuckbuckets](http://islamqa.info/en/10382).  Further, in the Qur'an you cite a verse from the 4th Surah follows my citation of 4:24, that clearly states all female slaves are kosher to use as fuckdolls, even the married ones.   This may all make sense together in the 7th Century, by it does nothing do dispel the clear existence of sex slavery. Just because you don't hit her over the head with a brick doesn't make the sex consensual.  Additionally, there is nothing in any of your citations to support your claim that sex had to be consensual with a female slave. Most of the ""treat slaves well"" stuff obtrusively excludes any discussion of sex at all. That's left to the verses that specifically claim the master has unfettered sexual access.  As for Hadith, I see you subscribe to Sunni Hadith including Abu Dawud, which is good because I have the following citation:  &gt;The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) were reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur’anic verse: (Qur'an 4:24) 'And all married women (are forbidden) unto you save those (captives) whom your right hands possess.  Further, let's take a look at some other instances of sex slavery:  Qur'an 33:26-27  &gt;And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew and ye made captive some. And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth, and land ye have not trodden. Allah is Able to do all things  Of course we're speaking of the Banu Qurayza. With her husband and all the males of her clan murdered, and the women and children sold into slavery, I seriously doubt Rayhana was ecstatic to have hairy old Mohammad grunting on top of her, and according to  Ibn Ishaq she refused to marry him and died a slave.   Funny, but I just had a very similar discussion with a Christian who also insisted that slavery was an A-OK deal for the slaves of the Hebrews.  Is this why people had to be conquered to become slaves? Or was there a waiting list of young virgins clamoring to become fuck meat for a bunch of filthy desert raiders?    &gt;Dude, that's ISIS. That's not Islam by the consensus of Muslims and Scholars  I'm sure they've done a few things that cross the line, but conquest in the name of Islam and enslaving the vanquished isn't two of them, and we both know that.  What they're doing is insisting on a return to Islam in its purest form, meaning the Islam that was practiced in the 7th Century by Muhammad and Abu Bakr - conquest and enslavement.  &gt;Obviously the definition of slavery that you have and the one that Islam provides is completely different.   Actually, I'm fairly certain that we have the exact same definition. The variable is that I think it's vile in any capacity.   &gt;How many slavers do you know that provide clothing equal to theirs and food equal to theirs and treat them like members of the family  I don't know any slavers. They're really not my type of people.  So what have we learned? We've learned that, like all religions 'morals' are in the eye of the beholder.   I fully trust that you believe everything you've said here. I'm sure that you are a good person that sees Islam at an angle that allows you to reconcile the barbaric portions of Islamic history and doctrine by blinding yourself to the portions that are indeed savage and sorely outdated.  ISIS sees it differently, and they are using the same scripture you adore to justify all manner of barbarity. Funny thing is, you're both right.  Let's hope your side wins before it's too late.",,0,0,t1_crr4l9r

However, I must be truthful and transparent here - the instruments make it feel like there should be more coming from the main vocal melodies. I think the vocal melody could be more interesting. Your singing isn't bad and nor does it ruin the song, but after listening to it a few times few I still couldn't really properly remember the tune coming from it.   Due to how smooth the backing stuff is, you could get away with making the rhythm more varied and use a larger range of notes.  I know how it can be though, when you've finished a song and all its lyrics the last thing you want to do is mess with the vocal line, so please keep in mind this is just my feedback on it.   Nevertheless, I really like how it's all blended together. The instruments sound pretty darn nice together, with all of them sitting nicely. It's a good sound set. Please, keep making more! It's cool stuff. ",,0,0,t3_37yt9i

I didn't let him off the hook. I reminded him of the lies he told, like he didn't mention when the sibs were coming into town to start the grab fest. I said that I didn't believe he didn't know the plans. He then garbled, screamed about a land shark, then said he had to go to dinner.    I told him the children he trusts are now in charge, and that should make him feel confident. He has no worries from me because he can stick a fork in me, I'm done. I said there is no one I would betray in such a fundamental way, much less my immediate family. But it affirms everything that I'd always believed, that I am not one of them, and there is now no denying that.    He didn't know that I knew the whole story, so every time he'd come up with a new lie I'd cut him down.   Angry? Hell yes.

The only similarity is the oval shape of the ball and even then a rugby ball is slightly pointier compared to the shape of an AFL football (commonly known as a Sherrin).   The goal in rugby is to carry the ball past a certain line, much like the endzone in American Football, and plant the ball down. On the way to doing this you cannot throw the ball forwards. You may kick the ball in any direction but there are certain rules about who may retrieve that ball depending on where they were in relation to the kicker when it was kicked.  AFL is completely different. The goal is to kick the ball between 4 posts, two tall and two short posts. If you kick the ball between the two middle posts it is 6 points and if you miss to either side and get it between the big and small posts you get 1 point. If the ball is touched at any point from the boot of a player and through the tall posts it counts as only 1 point instead of six.  Another difference is that the ball cannot be thrown and instead must be hit with a fist towards another player. The main form of passing is kicking though and you can kick the ball in any direction. If you catch the ball from a kick cleanly (without it being touched) you then have the option to take a set kick without being molested.   An AFL game is played on an oval field instead of a square field.  All in all it's a completely different game and has almost nothing in common with Rugby. Rugby has much more in common with American Football than Australian Football.",,0,0,t1_crr1oik

Buying used is great for your wallet, but they're not seeing that sale or tallying it off as a nonmatrix bra sold. Likewise, buy full price. A bra sold on sale isn't a success for them. Encourage the production of your size.  I categorically disagree with this. The sale was already made and the company saw it. If the original buyer returns the bra that is zero sales. If she resells it they still have one sale.  You're expecting that the person who buys the bra used or with a discount from a person who would return it would buy the bra anyway at full price. That's quite an assumption. Nobody wants to buy a used bra if they can afford a new one. Nobody wants to cross their fingers and hope that one of the few bra cuts that works for them goes on sale and isn't sold out in their size by that time.   Second hand bra markets are a necessity, not a frivolity that causes more manufacturers to produce only matrix sizes. If anything they convince people who would otherwise be wearing 2 band sizes too big and 2 cup volumes too small $15.99 bras from Target that their comfort and physical wellbeing is worth the investment of buying extended sizes. Second hand bra markets lose customers for mainstream bra stores and win them for ones who have a big size range.  EDIT: Second hand bra markets are also the reason why we have so much varied knowledge about different brands. If a bra from a less known brand is resold three times on Bratabase that means four people will review (and hopefully measure and photograph) it.",,1433116878,0,t1_crraqth

In retrospect I should had expected it since the first week sale numbers for volumes 9 and 10 (those released after the anime / this year) did increase by a lot.  By the end of the year World Trigger will sell a minimum of 2,000,000 total volumes. Depending if the 'anime effect' increases even more because of the invasion arc and next arc the numbers might be higher.  Anyways as you can see I am very excited and can't wait to see the sale numbers for the next volume being released next week and the one ~3 months from now and see how much total the series ends up selling for the year.

He tries, and usually converts, so many tip dunks and alley oops where he is flying off balance with people running underneath him. It seems like at least once a game his teammates will throw him an alley oop that is just rediculously dangerous to try and catch and I just wish someone would tell them to stop.

This is very apparent with Kirito and Sinon relying on eachother being stronger than they are.    I thoroughly enjoyed the last 2 arcs and can see why Mother Rosario is most peoples faves.

Attempting to use logic and reason to explain a situation is ""mansplaining.""  Telling a girl ""Hi"" on the street is ""street harassment."" Having sex with a drunk girl who wakes up the next day and realizes she doesn't like you is "" date rape.""  Basically modern feminism is openly antagonistic toward men and makes no bones about it.

Celica is a Nord whose parents no one has ever heard of. From the moment she opened her eyes, a scythe, almost twice her current size, has been her only companion. Of course, being born in the wilds of God knows where with none to protect you does come with several negatives. For Celica, it was being brought up as a slave by the Thalmor, who saw her as a tool for enjoyment. They took the scythe she held for the Chief of the fort they were holed up in to use and kept her down for 18 years. Until the attack. The elves ignored Celica, focusing on the grotesque formation of tentacles procured from an eye floating in the sky. It was mere moments before the entire fort was silent, save for the rasping of the creature and the breathing of the slave still confused as to what was happening. When she finally made it to the surface, she saw not a creature of hellish form but her saviour. She found her scythe(or rather, it found her) and swore her allegiance... nay, her life, to the glorious Hermaeus Mora, who would continue to assist her in her growth from a slave to the Dragonborn. However, whatever title she gained, whatever honour she had bestowed upon her, in her mind, Celica maintained a strange attraction to the Prince of Fate, hoping that one day, she would finally become his true eternal servant. (I'm still waiting for the Hermaeus Mora one(am currently settling for something not really similar but eh, good enough), but there is actually a mod for all the situations I detailed, including the Thalmor slave and ""tool for enjoyment"" situations. If you want me to show you, PM me. Warning, NSFW.)  ",,0,0,t3_37yjxx

Almost all high rise buildings have mail rooms.

And perishables would have a barcode scanned and refrigerated.  &gt;  yet doesn't seem to accept that other jobs will come instead.  They won't be repetitious labor jobs that for a lot of people are *all* they are capable of doing. I mean in the unemployable sense that Humans Need Not Apply refers to. People without the mental acuity to train an intellectual discipline that is not going to be automated in the short term. Anything involving elbow grease is already on deaths door, at best you will have someone bossing the machines around.  &gt; And what's the proof that the guy who puts human labour above tech will get crushed by the competition?  In my area at least a dozen small business locally owned stores have gone under in response to the rising ease and availability of both Walmart and Amazon like stores. You cannot compete on price, and at the end of the day we are still giving out social contact for free, so you don't need to spend money to interact with other people. Yet. That would be a real dystopia if thats what it came to, though...  &gt; There is a lot that goes into managing a store other then buying and selling cheap to get rid of the competition.   Its called a core competency. If the store is providing something other than goods, maybe it can survive on that, but I don't know of a single person that goes shopping for any other reason than to buy &lt;insert x primary reason to go&gt; and &lt;several y products the store persuades them to buy that they didn't need&gt;.

Feelings like suddenly losing control, confusion about what is happening, and feeling strangely in general can all be panic attack triggers, and can all be potentially caused by marijuana.   I have had problems with panic attacks over the years, both sober and high. When I got on the right medication and had therapy to help me understand the attacks, they went away for both my sober self and my high self. Learning about my father's depression and the genetic link between our conditions helped me come to terms with having high anxiety, and motivated me to control it. For me, the best way I found to control my panic attacks is to be very observant when they happen, learn what triggers them, and recognize when exposure to triggers occurs. Understanding what's happening generally helps you feel safe and in control.   I personally experience a complicated relationship between my marijuana use and my anxiety. When I'm high, I'm more susceptible to attacks. However, when I'm smoking regularly, I can control panic attacks much better sober. I personally believe the relationship between the drug and anxiety is very complex and different for everybody.   My advice on resolving problems with the relationship between the two is to be highly cognizant of the unique way your marijuana use and anxiety interact, and try to empirically learn as much as you can about it.   Quick tip for panic attacks: Simply recognizing that you are having an attack during the event is massively helpful. Knowing what's happening, even if it doesn't stop the attack, makes the event much more bearable. ",,0,0,t3_380are

Specifically, even though we're all playing criminals, this would be the crew that we can all trust. Problem player shows up with a character already created: a former cop, framed and trying to get back to law enforcement. In case you missed it two sentences ago, this is a game about criminals who can trust each other. She seemed to do everything she could to sow mistrust among the characters.  Many more things with that player occurred and eventually we called the game off (pausing for a few months, really) due to other circumstances. Problem player says she's moving cross-country. No problem. Bye.  A few months pass and I send out emails to the players that are still back in town. Yay, everyone wants to play! So we start the game up again and problem player pops up again. She somehow heard about the game going again, was still in town, and was pissed that I didn't invite her back: so she sent a big ""fuck you, assholes"" email to everyone in the group.   This was the first any of us had heard from her since we put the game on hiatus. Everyone in the group thought she up and moved out of state months ago.

All people tend to feel more comfortable as they become more attracted to another person.  After a time they will be more inclined to act on their feelings if they feel any friendship or more exists. It doesnt have to be physical, mental, or even in a sexual way. It's also natural for teenage boys (any age males really) to have a hard time distinguishing friendship from a relationship and where that boundary ends.  Even if they know your preference, they may assume that the fact that you pay attention to them means otherwise.  In short, it's most likely nothing you've done and you are going to have to deal with the not fun friend zone conversations everyone has to have.

You need to think about what it is you want to convey through that story (the feelings of the character, the life of this character before it ""exists"", or the process of becoming an existential being) and build your story around that. The character's voice needs to be a little more unique, and try not to use dialogue as an easy way to explain something to the reader. Use dialogue to express how the character thinks, or what they desire. And EVERY character should have a desire, even if it's just a glass of water. As far as the second story goes, I am very lost. It feels like it was rushed, and the lizard boy's character isn't believable. If the boy has a hard time understanding things, why would the father explain such complicated matters to him?

Consider Canon 2 from the fifth session of the council of Trent  &gt; If any one asserts, that the prevarication of Adam injured himself alone, and not his posterity; and that the holiness and justice, received of God, which he lost, he lost for himself alone, and not for us also; or that he, being defiled by the sin of disobedience, has only transfused death, and pains of the body, into the whole human race, but not sin also, which is the death of the soul; let him be anathema:--whereas he contradicts the apostle who says; By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.   Death and pains of the body are passed into the entirety of the human race due to Adam's prevarication.

Why do enclaves exist in the first place? Most neighborhoods in Toronto started as white and quickly morphed into ethnic enclaves. It's because (Anglo) whites all moved out when minorities reach a critical mass. If not for white flight, we'd see a more equitable distribution of minorities spread out across all neighborhoods.  For a minority to truly integrate requires social acceptance on behalf of the majority. This extends beyond superficial pleasantries and ""how was your weekend?"" small talk at the office. It involves white people living in your neighborhoods (and staying put even if colored faces pop up), extending friendships, inviting you into their own homes and their parties, and to be willing to date you (a survey revealed 7/10 of white women have a racial preference in dating, of which 95% excluded Indian men).

There is some good intro material at the Coffee and Canticles blog, and several other places. Most assume that you are using Christian Prayer or the 4-vol LoTH, but the way you pray the hours is the same regardless, it's just navigation of the books that is different (easier with Shorter Christian Prayer, since you only have Morning, Evening, and Night prayers and very limited Propers.)  I would suggest getting a couple holy cards (or business cards) for bookmarks in the propers and Night prayer, some sticky tabs for the Invitatory, antiphons to the Blessed Virgin, the page with the seasonal hymn listing, and a few of your favorite hymns (although if you're praying in common, you probably won't need hymns stickied), and use the built in ribbon in the Psalter (tomorrow is Monday of Wk 1).

We are paying them with our data, then advertisers pay them with money.   In that case, air isn't free either because you're ""paying"" by exhaling carbon dioxide which plants use for their own respiration.  But while technically correct, that's not  very practical or useful way of looking at it. The fact remains that when you sign up for a gmail account, you _don't give them any money_. In that sense, it is free. If they benefit from it, that's fine.  You also skipped over the example of hobbyists. Look at linux. It's an operating system that you can download free of charge. Somebody made it. Not for money. They just decided to make it and make it available. Look at all the people making videos on youtube. They don't charge you for those videos. They mostly make them because they want to, and they're available to you free of charge.  In a society where essentials are cheap or free and so there's no need to work a job for money to survive, there will suddenly be a _lot of people_ will a lot of spare time on their hands. Some of those people will make stuff and make it available to others. _We already see that happen now_. If technology can bridge that gap from electronic to physical goods, so that hobbyists can make physical things available as cheaply as they already make electronic goods, that is a game changer.  Don't think that gmail and facebook cannot exist without advertising money. There are _millions_ of computers running linux right now, without the benefit of advertising dollars. As more and more stuff becomes free, and less effort is required to acquire what people want, the less effort will be required to get the stuff we want, the more people will be willing to do stuff without receiving money.  At some point, money becomes unnecessary.  &gt;For food, you're basically talking about replicators  That's one solution, but it's not the only solution. The example I already gave is probably much closer technologically. Personally, I have an apple tree in my back yard. It rains enough that we don't even need to water it. It's there and it makes apples. Food is a thing that you can make yourself.  As you point out, a lot of people don't do that. That's fine. If technology makes it _+easier_, more people will do it.  Again, the example I gave in the previous post: consider all the in vitro meat posts we've been seeing in /r/futurology lately. There are already people who brew beer and make cheese in their kitchen. I've don't it myself. What if somebody makes a simple countertop meat-growing kit that you pour water and a nutrient packet into, and it makes a gallon of meat for you overnight? Food costs plummet. No more 100 care cattle ranches. No more shipping meat hundreds of miles. You, and restaurants and everyone else can grow their own meat as easily as baking bread. And then somebody build a countertop algae kit that converts water and sunlight into the nutrient paste you need.  That's something we could possibly do right now, without matter replicators.

Large infrastructure bills are terribly vulnerable to pork amendments. Bridges to nowhere, Lawrence Welk Historical sites, monuments to the oppressed Estonian laborers, blah, blah. All these get added to large, inchoate bills.  Before Watergate, the President could, if he wanted, just *not spend* the money on specific projects. When Nixon was weakened by Watergate, the Congress decreed that all appropriations had to be spent. Since he was so weak, Nixon never challenged the provision in court. Nobody knows if he woukd have succeeded or not. This had two bad effects.  First, it meant that pork barrel politics could proceed unimpeded, blasting government spending up.  Second, it weakened the Presidency relative to the Congress. It took away a great club from the President. ""Oh, you won't support my (insert initiative here)? Well, sorry, but the Senator Foghorn J Leghorn Community Spa isn't going to get built"".  Is this good? Who knows, but there are a lot of Foghorn J Leghorn centers being built these days. My state, Vermont, was and is famous for them. The Leahy Echo Center on Lake Champlain, built because Leahy held up the Great Lakes Initiative until Lake Champlain could be designated as a Great Lake.  Champlain is, indeed, a really nice Lake, and the Echo Center is very cool (It's right down there on Bernie's Waterfront), but it is still pork barrel spending.  For most of my life, Vermont Senators have had two roles. The Senior Senator got to play Statesman, and did. The Junior Senator brought home the bacon, and did. Vermont never unelected a sitting Senator, and only once in modern memory a sitting Congressman. (We only have one).   Who defeated that sitting Congressman? Bernie. Because the incumbent had broken his word to never vote for a gun control bill. Conservatives and Republicans (not always the same people here) were furious, and Bernie waltzed home with the win.",,0,0,t3_37zz93

Think of it this way, prior to an athletic activity or workout, often times a sore or injured muscle requires some heat/stretching to loosen up and get active before you can really exercise that particular muscle. It also can get a good sweat going. In college, when I played D1 sports, I would have to spend a good 20 minutes in the hot tub some mornings before meetings and practice just to know I'd be able to make the entire workout.  But post-workout, you definitely don't want to go steam or hot tub unless you are finishing with an ice bath and/or ice cold shower for a period of at least 2 sets of 60 seconds. I advise stretching before this as well, as you can feel extremely ""locked up"" for hours after if you don't. Honestly, I would say the effects are felt much more on the joints and back than just normal muscular soreness, and it isn't for most people. Most non-athletes I advise to just massage soreness out on an as-needed basis with a large ice block or cube. I always keep 2-3 dixie cups in my freezer with frozen water for when the patellas flare up  TL;DR- Stick to stretching and sort form of icing down in post-workout, save the steam-room and hot tub for off-days or prior to a workout to improve mobility and alleviate some soreness, and definitely do not do these after a workout unless you are well-hydrated and can tolerate the potential extra inflammation/soreness.",,0,0,t1_crqz26o

AFAIK a 980 (not overclocked) plays most *new* games at around 60 on ultra or more (1440), so you could aim for a 980 and then lower the settings on the newest games (medium-high) to get your ~100 fps. Other than that, the 980 should destroy most other games on the highest settings if they aren't the newer releases.   The Witcher may be the exception because it plays it around 50 on ultra, and I heared lowering the settings on it doesn't improve the FPS too much for whatever reason. Maybe they fixed that, or will.   Also, I heard getting a 970/290 can be a problem with 1440p because of the lower amount of VRAM (2gigs). AFAIK this is only relevant in the newer games, but if you plan to keep the build a while it's important to know.   To your last comment on pixel perfect, I heard it's not worth it, because while you can send it back if you do get the dead pixel, it will cost you shipping fees back to Korea, which I heard was around ~$150 (not sure if this is right but its expensive) AFAIK the highest rated sellers are pretty good about trying to get high quality monitors out, and sending back the bad ones. The panels on these monitors are the weakpoint, so it is all up to chance, you can get a dead pixel or be lucky. I also heard that these monitors might come with some panel light leaking, which can be fixed, but you take your chances with these monitors. Most people are very happy with what they get.  Besides alot of times you can only see the dead pixel if you get one in certain conditions, the same goes for the light leak.   Also, other brands of monitors can give dead pixels too, I've read stories of people trying to pay the extra amount for the ""higher quality"" brand and still getting one. In the end it's usually just one pixel and you will be able to ignore it before you realize    Hope this helps, it's coming from another person who is really looking into getting 1440p vs 1080 144hz",,0,0,t1_crqults

The problem with being an exit node, of course, is that when someone is connected through you and does something illegal or against your ISP’s terms of service, you could be held accountable—and since Hola makes no promises to encrypt your traffic, it carries the same risk that using a service like Tor does (even if that risk is slight.) By using Hola, you’re trusting that the users connecting to you aren’t doing anything crazy, and that Hola would stop them from doing anything illegal.  In other words, someone could use Hola to torrent or do something similarly illegal, but your IP address could be the one authorities trace it back to, even if you physically didn't commit the crime.  &gt; This would all be fine if you were just an exit node for other users, but it turns out that Hola has been aggregating and selling the bandwidth of its user “exit nodes” through a service (which Hola also owns) called Luminati. This means anyone who wants to can essentially buy the bandwidth of Hola users, then direct it as they see fit—and that’s what one user did. He bought up a ton of bandwidth from Luminati and used it to attack anonymous message board 8chan.  Additionally, Hola is selling this bandwidth for anyone to use as they see fit, which has resulted in attacks that could again be traced to your IP address even if you didn't take part.  **TL;DR** Hola's developers are allowing anyone who damn well pleases to use your IP address to mask their identity online, which could result in any illegal activity being traced back to you.",,0,0,t3_380he7

Only if I feed and care for my children can I say that I love them, it is the same with God. There is a lot of play on words, because the good prophets were playing at politics so they were well suited by ambiguously allowing that you just have to sit around and pay the churches taxes and that God will do the rest, in the way of the Greek temples. Most of their audience was Greek. The very fact that the prophets don't strongly word it that God will just take care of you if you just pay your taxes was in fact radical at the time. They have to word things such that the people that had been used to bribe the gods can understand how it is that God works for them. And the answer is, you have to follow God's way (love God, open to God, come to God, do God's will etc.) The belief of a lack of free will holds no water, it defeats itself, but then again people don't think about it much and just swallow whatever slogan gets thrown their way.",,0,0,t1_crrarx6

What are people really expecting them to show about the core FE experience? Realistically speaking here, it's not particularly complicated. The main aspects of it are classes (which we've had information on), characters (which we've had information on), any alterations to the base mechanics (which we've had information on), and plot/maps (which they can only tell us so much about without spoiling everything).  Fire Emblem, though full of depth, isn't a particularly complex game. You move your characters around on maps, complete whatever the map objective is, manage your resources, and cry as the RNG punches you in the mouth. It's not like many other games out there where there's an abundance of gameplay changes between releases -- the core of it stays the same.  So yeah, it seems like they're changing the quintessential Fire Emblem experience. But I think that's because there's been so much focus on stuff like what we saw today, as opposed to the actual strategy element, which has more or less (presumably) stayed the same. They've highlighted the more egregious changes (weapon durability, weapon triangle, etc.) -- unless they're changing anything else, there's not much more to talk about.",,0,0,t3_3805yg

The gas can also easily be argon as well as helium.  The molecules also don't 'flow through' at different rates.  They have a certain degree of 'attraction' to the material lining the walls of the column and the time it takes for the material to elute (-not- flow) off the column is inversely proportional to the degree of 'attraction' that the material experiences with the walls of the column.  The attraction in most ordinary GC's is based on polarity and you can have normal or reversed-phased columns.  You can also have columns that are based on molecule size that act like molecular 'sieves,' making smaller or larger molecules elute at different rates.  You can also have columns that are constructed with enzymes in the walls to induce particular molecules to bind to them to the exclusion of other compounds.  This also just gives you separation and retention time.  It doesn't say anything about what combination of odorants corresponds to a 'smell' that our brains can pick out.  It would just tell us what individual molecules are in a particular sample of gas.  Now, if you could determine a particular chromatogram for a grouping of odorants that our brain recognizes as a 'smell,' and then match the chromatogram with a saved database of 'smellograms,' then we would be talking.  But a GC by itself would tell you pretty much nothing from a macro-perspective (e.g., 'what does this smell like?').  ",,0,0,t1_crqzmaf

Their Studio Monitors are incredibly clean and precise speakers.   My problem/question: My Nakamichi RE-2 died. I'm temporarily forced to use my old JVC POS and I get better sound from my PC now.   I haven't searched for stereo equipment in probably a generation and I'm worried about considering brands that were once high-mid quality, that are now Chinese POS.   I run 4 B&amp;W DM-602's and I'm currently using an old JVC CD player with a nice warm DAC that I am satisfied with. It's not a weak link in the system like the receiver is. I do not need a receiver, unless wanting to connect to my TV/DVD player requires one. I don't know if the AM/FM receiver is also used by TV and/or DVD's. I ran an old Nikko integrated amp until I blew a few transistors in it.   Since the added components of a receiver have to cost something, is there any price savings by going straight to an integrated amp?   Are there companies that are worth looking at that I would not have looked at 10 years ago.   I've had decent luck with NAD, Nakamichi, Nikko, Denon and Marantz products in the past. I think NAD and Marantz are out of my budget this time. Any recommendations anyone has will be appreciated.   I'd like to stay under 500US and closer to 300 is even better.

But we must be careful not to confuse that with complexity. Moscow is the only European city in the world's top 25 most populous urban areas, and the next largest, Paris, is not even a third the size of the number one spot. But nobody's asking why Shanghai is ""much more complex"" than London. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1v5n7x/what_differences_caused_the_mesoamerican/) post is my go to reference for this topic. As you'll read, much of the perceived ""complexity"" of southern architecure assumes a hierarchy of stone over earth or brick. The monumental constructions of North America were built with exacting precision and an engineer's intimate knowledge of the construction materials.  A variety of factors did direct many North American societies away from very large cities: access to quality crops, separately evolved sociopolitical arrangements, and more. Many of the other ""complex developments"" are really only adaptations to an urban environment. Who gives a darn for ledger sheets and complex waterworks unless you have a city where they can be useful? But in the end, it's always difficult to give satisfactory answers for why something *didn't* happen. Our work as historians and archaeologists is explaining how thing did happen. Latent in the question of ""why didn't they"" is some idea of a natural, normal progression that requires unique circumstances to push someone off track. Archaeologists aren't even in agreement on how urbanism developed at specific North and South American sites, and it's undoubtedly different for regions within the same country.",,0,0,t1_crr93oq

It is not unlocked, but usually overclocking does not bring you that many performance gains except on a really shitty processor.  [(2600K vs 4670K, which is pretty much identical to the 4590 minus .2 GHz-AnAndTech)](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/287?vs=837)  The motherboard is a quality value one using the H97 chipset, which is identical to Z97 excepting for the fact that you can't overclock. (Locked CPU anyway so...)  You don't need more than 8GB RAM for gaming, and probably won't for a couple years to come.  High quality 120GB fast SSD that is enough to put Windows and a couple games on.  1TB highly rated and reliable HDD for games/media.  Modern AMD gaming GPU that will handle most games at 1080p, maxed out settings, 60FPS. The HD 7850 GPU is probably the weakest part in this build, and would struggle to break 30FPS on most games at high settings.   [(7850 vs 290X-AnAndTech)](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1076?vs=1056)  No frills but very functional case that still looks passable.  80+ Bronze rated and semi modular PSU.  Cheap, small IPS monitor good for entry level gaming.   Backlit gaming keyboard (red) bundled with a gaming mouse, should serve you well but you can always upgrade to something better later.  Speakers with good sound quality that won't blow the house down.  This PC does not have some of the functionality that the posted build had (240GB SSD storage, dual monitors, water cooling, DVD drive or 16GB 2133MHz RAM to name a couple) but it will overall perform much better in games, especially if you will only be gaming.  I could see that prebuilt being a good value for someone who does something besides gaming (video rendering or scientific computation, for example) but it does not suit you. ",,0,0,t3_37zmya

However, there is a huge difference between a society that experiences greed, and a society that actively encourages and rewards it. If you look at the things we value, you'll see just how greedy we really are. We think it's acceptable, no, desirible for a person to have much more than they really need. We are impressed by mansions and sports cars and fancy clothes, we don't think about how the person that bought them could have used that money to benefit others.  Infact, there seems to be no real moral obligation for the rich to do anything. We in America see amassing wealth as a morally neutral activity, when it is far from it. We have this unspoken assumption that a person is entitled to as much material wealth as they can possibly get, no matter how much other people might need it. I think it is acceptable to spend money on things to make yourself happy, but there is a limit. There is a huge difference between buying an Xbox and owning a mansion. Almost everyone has more than they need, which is fine, but at some point it becomes irresponsible and immoral. Our conception of fairness is insane. Fairness is not getting to keep your bus seat because you got there first, (because you earned it), fairness is giving up your bus seat to an elderly person because they need it more than you do. You might have gotten it first, through your own effort, but is it really fair that you keep something you absolutely do not need at the expense of someone who absolutely does need it?  That is the biggest question behind the morality of wealth, and I think it's a question that needs be asked more and more.   ",,1433117230,0,t1_crr977v

I got close and asked the kid directly to apologize and be careful. He looked at me directly in the eyes and pinched one of my legs, unbelievable, so we keep staring at each other and I start to feel sorry for him, obviously he is not in the best place if that's the kind of behavior he has learnt.   I notice he is wearing a green sports shirt, way too fancy for his age. Suddenly I say ""Wow man, that shirt is cool, do you do sports? You look like a ninja turtle"". His expression changed immediately and after a few seconds he replies he loves ninja turtles, tells me a few random facts I forgot and then goes down the slide.

Get more proper rest; being tired (you don't even have to be **sleepy**) puts your body on the defensive. When our ancestors were tired, they'd have to be extra alert for predators and competitors.  Focus on the bridge of the nose of the person you're having a conversation with. Actually focus on it. It will take conscious efforts for a while. Practice in a mirror. You don't have to stare directly into one of their eyes and trying to do so will tend to make you want to switch to the other eventually. Right between the eyes gives the accurate impression that you are giving them your attention.  It IS okay to look away from your conversation partner. A 100% unbroken stare can be off-putting.  Finally, maybe you should look into anxiety counseling. It's entirely possible (and usually likely) that you do have some sort of anxiety even when you think you're comfortable. Maybe you are comfortable with the conversation, but if you're suffering from anxiety about work or your love life or your financial situation, you will have trouble focusing properly.",,0,0,t3_37zpgd

And its hard to justify that extra money when it could be spent on an eyepiece, or something else.  I do think the standard advice of ""Buy a big dob and let er rip"" is actually pretty terrible advice, there is a very good reason why there are always tons of 8""+ dobs on sale everywhere. They're too bulky, take up too much space, and most potential young observers tend to live in urban environments, which means the scopes get used MAYBE once a month.   I'd rather they get started with the frowned upon ""starter scopes"" with 4-5"" of aperture, and get their kicks studying the moon, some of the brighter DSO's, and the planets - if you've been doing this for a while, you get kind of jaded. Heck, I used to be annoyed when the moon was past half because I couldn't see faint fuzzies anymore, but doing way more outreaches reminds me just how exciting the moon can be, especially to someone new to the hobby.

Bernie has a precise agenda that he plans to accomplish and is never afraid to elaborate on how he will execute on it. And whether you realize it or not, his issues impact every single US citizen. In fact, I'd argue accomplishing his agenda is more important than fixing mass surveillance. If you fix the problems he has outlined, you've fixed Washington and that opens the doors to fixing everything else.   And I'm curious, minus surveillance what is you really love about Rand Paul so much that should put Bernie Sanders to shame?

At my parents for the summer and thought I'd do a little clean up on my old gaming PC (which is why I'm using an 8 year old CPU). Initially I wasnt surprised that it wasnt working (it is after all 8 years old) but then I checked the system requirements and the Q6600 is listed as minimum requirement, and there are lots of videos on youtube of people playing the game on their Q6600s.  I updated the graphics drivers two days ago, I dont think its a GPU issue as the task manager shows the CPU overloading while the GPU has no problems.   I checked for CPU errors with the Intel CPU Diagonistics Tool but it all looked okay, guess I'll just have to admit defeat and realize that the Q6600 isnt capable of the job no matter what EA says!

As a bit of a disclaimer, you're not going to get them completely even without losing a lot of thickness, and the thickness of your brows suits your face well. I've tried to balance keeping them thick with evening them out.   The left hand picture is the before, the centre is the after, and the right is a diagram to show where I'd pluck or trim the hairs (red) and where I'd fill in (blue). I think a major thing that would make them look neater is the tails- they're a bit long, quite thick, and point very downwards. If you made them a bit shorter, tapered them to make them ""sharper"", and angled them slightly more outwards rather than down I think it would complement your face better. As for evening out the insides, taking a little off the bottom of the left brow (in the image, so your right) to give it a more curved edge like the right brow, and taking some off the top of the right brow to make it straighter like the left brow are the main things. Then I'd round out the inside of the right brow as it's a bit pointy compared to the left.   Do you already have a product you use to fill in your brows? I recommend something like either a sharp pencil or dipbrow applied with a thin, stiff-bristled eyeliner brush as these will most easily replicate hairs rather than filling in your brows completely (unless that's the look you're going for.) I'd use these to square up the top of the inner corner of your left brow and straighten the bottom edge of the right brow.   Phew, I'm sorry if that was a lot of words. Where possible, try to trim hairs rather than pluck, and if you're not confident it's a good idea to go to a professional, and specify that you want them evening out without losing too much of the thickness. If you like how they look in the picture I made, you could take that if you wanted. Getting them professionally done once and then plucking the strays is a tactic many of us use to maintain our brows at a low cost.  I hope that helps!",,0,0,t3_380e15

""Supposed to"" is a strange thing to say about how life has evolved. Not to mention that some ovaries are in hard shells that don't seem to 'want' to be eaten. Furthermore, I don't understand what any of this has to do with grossness.  &gt;while in general you don't want someone chowing down on your period since it can transmit diseases if you're not healthy.  I do find the idea of eating a human period gross, of course, but, whether for evolutionary, cultural, or personal reasons, that's because of its properties, not because they are menses.  So yes, eating human periods is gross (to nearly everyone, I assume), but the reasoning is *Eating human periods is gross. Periods are menses. Therefore eating menses is gross.* is just as bad as *Eating circus peanuts is gross. Circus peanuts are candy. Therefore, eating candy is gross.*  &gt; Hiding a period for a mammal, for example, is a biological imperative because it makes it easier for predators to track you.

My biggest excitement about them is their build quality. They are made of a thick, dense, and sturdy plastic with metal used here and there. They feel solid and expensive, and I like that, as I am taking them off a lot -- for reasons.   They are comfortable and the mic sounds fine (from what I've been told in-game). I really enjoy the soft fabric material on the earcups. Not the cheap leathery material I've seen on other ""gaming"" branded headset.   Lastly, wireless. It's so handy not having to worry about getting up to open the window or door or to help my lady with something she needs and having the cord get caught or tangled.  A little pricey - but so far, I haven't want to take them back and get a different set to save money.",,0,0,t1_crrae6b

I was actually pretty excited at the idea of dressing in flattering clothes at work, but am not very girly and had a wardrobe of jeans and tshirts.  What I ended up doing is going to a higher-end clothing store (I chose White House Black Market from a friend's recommendation) with some of my savings, and just telling the associates my story. ""I just got out, need office clothes, and have no clue how to dress myself. I don't know my size, but I do know I prefer black and neutral colors. Bright colors frighten me."" I was embrassingly honest, but the woman told me to browse while she collected some things for me in a dressing room to try on.  Few things made me feel as *riche* as walking into that dressing room and seeing it full of carefully chosen and displayed clothing, in my size (she'd eye balled it for me), and in styles I liked. She'd paid attention to my short story well enough that I loved almost every item she picked for me, and she'd made sure everything was perfect for my body type, too! I ended up spending something like four and a half hours that day trying stuff on, and she walked me thru why certain styles looked good and how I could mix and match different things to turn three purchases into five different outfits. It was a long time for someone like me to spend ""shopping for clothes,"" but I learned a lot and walked out with a decent start at a professional wardrobe.  The major downside to that experience is that I'm a little hooked on high proced clothing now (they're higher quality cuts and fabrics and I feel and *look* amazing wearing them), but the upside is I passed the test when I went back two weeks later and announced, ""I dressed myself today! Did I do good?"" everyone signed off on my ability to build an attractive and professional ensemble.  I highly recommend you do the same. The associates at those stores are trained to cater to you - that is, to understand what you're looking for and help you find it - and trained in fashionable dress - what looks good on what body types, what pairs well with what, how to accessorize, etc. They're customer service is usually phenomenal, too, and they shouldn't make you feel uncouth or like a waste of time.",,0,0,t3_37zb2m

It's like he was never challenged to think about why he feels the way he feels.

They wanted to **win**, no matter the cost. The opinion of Gallifrey itself on this matter was unknown until *Day of the Doctor*, where the one line we get in reference to *End of Time* is one of the commanders saying ""the High Council has plans of its own"". My assumption is that the High Council went nuts and broke away from the rest of Gallifrey, knowing full well that the general population would not be onboard with their plans.  Which brings us back to your question. Ten was stopping Rassilon and his insane High Council in *The End of Time*, not Gallifrey and the time lords as a whole. With them taken care of, War, Ten, and Eleven can later deal with Gallifrey and the rest of the time lords in *Day of the Doctor*. They are all cool with saving Gallifrey and the time lords, but not if it meant letting Rassilon execute his universe-ending winning play. That was the difference between the two scenarios: the presence of Rassilon and the High Council.  EDIT: I still feel like it's tough to explain, I'll try to TL;DR: Pretend that time is space for a second. If you look to your left, you see Rassilon and the High Council tearing shit up for the sake of winning. Ten stops them, this is *The End of Time*. If you look to your right, you see the war room, full of Gallifreyan commanders trying to kill enough daleks to continue breathing. War, Ten, and Eleven help them, this is *Day of the Doctor*. Different time lords, different threats. With both situations ""handled"", Gallifrey is now safe for recovery.",,1433119299,0,t3_37y6x4

You cite James Harden's improvement (and he certainly did improve) but *nobody* had any issues calling out his defense for the past two seasons. Why is K. Love getting a pass (in this thread, at least)?",,0,0,t1_crrb4m0

Takumi's father would fill a paper cup with water and put it in the cupholder. If the cup spilled water, the tofu in the trunk would spill also and the soft tofu would be demolished completely, making the delivery useless.  Takumi eventually got bored of the mindless deliveries and started going as fast as he can without spilling the water. He starts incorporating drifting and other techniques so he could corner fast without spoiling the delivery.  This is the basic premise of Initial D.

He doesn't shout or scream or flail about, but he does ramble nonsensically at times, never seems to look in the right direction, and has an odd speech pattern in which he repeats himself, and likes to rhyme things. What he *does* talk about terrifies people. He'll describe what he went through, what he had taken from him, in more detail than anybody wanted . Coupled with the fact that he (sorta) still has his wits about him, but has absolutely zero fucks left to give about anything, frightens everyone. No pain can compare to what he's already faced. Death no longer scares him. His Nuncles don't scare him. If his eyes are set on the Sea Stone chair, he has no reason to not pursue it, and no discrimination against those who would stand in his way.   Imagine this: After magically escaping the shitstorm of the North, Asha drags Theon back to the Iron Islands, declaring the previous Kingsmoot unlawful since Theon was not present. Victarion and Euron are off doing Kraken things, but the remaining Iron Born take one look at Theon with his downcast head, lanky build, lack of fingers, hair white, and start laughing. "" 'The Prince of Winterfell' indeed."" ""You expect this broken old man to rule us?"" ""He can barely stand on his own!""  And Theon, although still broken in appearance, raises his head and stares at them with the cold eyes of a man who has nothing in the world left to fear. ""Have any of you ever known what it feels like to have the skin peeled inch by inch from your fingers? Would you ever consider cutting your fingers off to be a relief-- the greatest relief you've ever felt in your life, sweeter than the kisses of a thousand maids? Have you ever been dragged to your own pyre with nothing but laughter in your throat, grinning at the man holding your torch? You're all fools, the lot of you. If you don't know the pain that this world can bring, you know nothing of this world at all."" Blah blah blah, pain, shame, blame, Jeyne, you get the idea.

Bartholomew actually picked the right issue that we should talk about, but makes the wrong arguments about it.   The current definition of poverty has some wacky effects to certain scenarios. For example, if food prices or rent dropped, that somehow doesn't reduce poverty, but if a lot of very rich people went bankrupt and lost everything, that somehow improves poverty. When the measure actually follows what is likely to increase or decrease poverty, it's often incidental and not proportional.  What left wingers should really do is point out that our measure of poverty is far far too obsessed with money and income and ignores the human element of poverty. People don't live by the number on their paycheck, they have different obligations and circumstances, and if they have to sacrifice something which is fundamental to humane living to meet a different obligation, that's poverty.

When you consider what we were told in school and have had pounded into our head all our lives and think through it fresh, it is just so ridiculous.  1.  The earth is a spinning ball 2.  The earth revolves around the sun as do some other planets 3.  This whole solar system is also hurtling through space.  And then you ask yourself some questions: 1.  Like the one posed in this video.  If the earth is a spinning ball like we are told, then either the atmosphere moves with it, or it does not.  The model doesn't work either way for a number of reasons (like plane flights flying against the direction of rotation).  But this video shows that even if you escape the atmosphere things don't work out.  Also, if the atmosphere spins, then it moves really fast at the equator, and not at all at the poles.  It also would need to move faster the higher up you go.  2.  In the video, look at the level of the horizon, it rises to the camera level.  If the earth were a globe you should have to look down at the horizon, more and more so as you go up.  3.  The horizon is flat, try putting a flat line across the screen.  For a sphere of circumference 25000 miles (what we are told), the curvature should be seen.  A lot of cameras have fish-eye lenses to give curve effect, but you can see this by how they curve other objects.  4.  Water shows no curvature over long distances.  ...lots more  The earth is flat.

Edit: what I meant earlier is that you can reprogram your brain in a desirable way and live a better life by doing things like being mindful of your thoughts, taking them in for what they are, analyzing them; maintining a skeptical outlook; treating other people as you would treat yourself, etc.  It's also a good idea to be open to the possibility that your goals, values, and more will change as you progress.",,1433156894,0,t1_crrazwz

If it was open to territories or other countries, it would be listed.  This may seem trivial, but when doing consumer research, it is important to be able to generalize your findings to your target population.  Given places like Puerto Rico and other territories are geographically removed from the US, have different languages, and different cultures, including responses collected from these places could skew your results and lead to inaccurate overall conclusions.

In that case, testing all of the sensors would be a good place to start, and maybe your hood sensor was out of specification. Out of specification ≠ broken.  On modern cars, you really need to be a computer technician first and a mechanic second. I'm almost 100% certain that if they go check out the appropriate measuring blocks and adaptations, they'll see the service interval is set wrong. They can fix it in a couple of clicks.  Of course, it is normally not necessary to set the service interval at all, as it is set properly from the factory. The only reason it would be set to a non-default value would be that someone wanted the car to come in for oil changes more (or less) often. The only reason I have for that is greed.

But the story mode has proven important for me in terms of gearing up for online play.  If you have the Amiibo 3-pack, you can earn armor by doing Story mode, then completing the challenges unlocked by each amiibo.  I had a full set of Power Armor pretty much starting out online. Each item has 3 slots. By Level 8 in Turf War, I had 9 abilities and some fresh looking armor. It really helped balance the fact that I was a noob going in there.  The other thing is Weapons Blueprints. You get them from killing bosses in Octo Valley. Aerospray is one of them.

But I'll just tell one story.  I was paired with the first roommate by the school because we were both being transferred from other buildings so we just got stuck together. I checked out her roommate profile thing on the school website to see what kinda chick she was, and every single answer was the opposite of mine. For example- Her favorite music, country. Mine, everything but. She was catholic, I say Hail Satan when someone sneezes. But I thought, hey maybe she's still an alright person! Different strokes!  Nope. She would hardly ever make eye contact with me, hardly say a word even if I tried to engage her, would leave the room immediately whenever I got home or just turn her country music up to full volume to cut off any communication, watch shitty tv on full volume all night (with the screen only facing where she could watch, not me) and was just not interested in being friends at all. I still thought it would be fine, shits annoying but I don't *need* to be friends with my roommate. But then I come home one day to find her half of the room empty. I talk to my RA, who was also a friend, and he tells me that she had gone to the RD (resident director, above the RAs) to ask for a roommate switch because ""I play music too loud and she can't study"" which didn't make any sense because I always used headphones.  Later on, I found out that she had told a few people she moved out because I made her uncomfortable because.. Get this! I'm not straight. Now, I'm not sure how she found that out since she never spoke to me and it's not like I was bringing a bunch of girls home but it's still not a secret. But I had NEVER hit on her or made her uncomfortable in any way. I was pretty offended, and shocked because we were in Austin, TX which is a city known for it's more liberal attitude towards things like homosexuality. Maybe not as ""horror story""esque as some of the others here but it still sucked.

Things landlords would need to take care of. I'm not trying to discourage you or anything just give you some perspective if you think home-owning is worry free! You generally will always worry about spilling stuff on carpet for one reason or another (exception: if you are 2 weeks away from ripping carpet up to have it replaced - that was a fun 2 weeks :-) ). In places where I've rented in the past we were allowed to hang pictures but were expected to patch holes but I guess rules can vary. To save for a deposit we lived in a dodgy granny-flat for a while, lived in a few different very small places for a few years and worked a lot of weekends to help save, and didn't blow money on cars, kept debt-free, etc. We also live in Sydney's west and deal with a looong commute into work everyday, also the only way we could afford to buy our own place.

I'm offered a job in a union shop. Does the owner/management offer me the choice to make $10 an hour, shitty insurance, no earned PTO, no sick leave, etc or union wage, good benefits, leave, etc. if I join the union?   No, he offers me the equivalent of union wages, maybe even a bit better of a package. Good for me, right? Eventually, enough people leave the union. I mean, why pay $5, $10 a week when I get the same thing without?   So, less than half the shop is union now. Contract renewal is here. The employees out of the union decide to vote against a new contract. The union employees are given a choice, leave the union or their jobs. Most, even with union pay won't be able to just quit, so they say goodbye to the union.   A few months later and suddenly employees are getting laid off and replaced with temps. Ones who aren't are told that they can either take a pay cut or be replaced. Oh, and all that leave? Ha! Forget it. It's gone. Or even better, there will be ""black out times"" when no scheduled PTO can be used. Also, you'll now be written up for using sick leave.   Benefits renewal comes around and those nice insurance packages? Replaced with second rate, barely legal HMOs or high deductible plans.

People like and admire actors but most people don't consider them really working or the difficulty that may go into it; therefore they rarely respect it. The babying part is complex but mostly socialized. A big part of it is arguably ego related. Since most people don't even draw as a hobby and most believe it's something you have or you don't have they are easily impressed. When you're impressed and someone knocks it it is insulting to you. ""This is the best pizza i've ever had!"" ""I think it's gross"" and all of the sudden you're a party pooper, troll, terrible person. People feel like they're stupid or have bad taste and cognitive dissonance kicks in. We need more criticism in all art related fields actually.   You don't take jokes seriously unless the seriousness outweighs the joke. This is where my 'snobbery' must kick in. Art made for Art is more distilled and taken seriously. It's not graphic design for a product or characters for a comic book, those things are constructed on a function that deters from the pure impact.   In fact if this guy's comic was created as 'real' art it might be seen quite a bit differently. In fact it might even be seen as an argument for SWJ's, it would probably have a darker context. Instead it is seen in the light of fun humor, something outside of the gallery, which leaves a viewer thinking it is either funny or a callous joke that should be more sensitive to a serious issue.

Whether that number is 50 or 2, it wouldn't bother me all that much, I would just think of him slightly differently.   A higher number equates to more experience and an open mind, but I might be a tad bit jealous about certain things, namely whether he thought I was better or worse in bed, and how many of those women he thought were more attractive than me.   A lower number could indicate inexperience, perseverance and loyalty. In this case I could be jealous for different reasons. Was he with each girl for 5 years? Did he love her more than me? Or were they one night stands?   Overall though, the number doesn't mean all that much to me. When did they sleep with all these people? Over the course of 15 years, or all in a few months? How long ago? Each little piece of information can give a number a whole new meaning depending on the circumstances. I've been with a lot of people. 30+. But over the past 5 years (ish), it's only been 3 people. That means I slept with a lot of people in a small chunk of time, a good while ago, and I'm less promiscuous now. If I want my partner to respect me for having a particular number, I have to respect his too. People change, learn and grow.   As for an ex chiming in about how good or bad they were in bed... No. I don't want to hear any of that. I'm ok with hearing a few things here and there, such as chit chatting about the craziest places we've had sex and what turns us on, but I don't want to know who thought who was good in bed and why. That's not necessary. And if his ex were talking to me about his sexual habits, I'd wonder why in the hell she's even thinking about it.   An ex is an ex for a reason. It's in the past, leave it at that. ",,0,0,t3_38042n

Someone should have ALL THE FACTS before deciding.  And if you exclude teaching about religion or Christianity you're being just as biased.

That's why I'm giving you the straight skinny here, and offering advice. In the interest of disclosure, I don't consider myself affiliated with this circus, just a very knowledgeable observer.   So what I'm saying here is that B&amp;B *has* acted politically, and *has* taken a side, and *is* on the side of discrimination. They caved to people *who were yelling abuse at them,* which is probably the worst aspect of this. How can you take the word of people calling you names, and choose to act according to their wishes? It's craven.  If you continue to converse with admin at B&amp;B, you should refer them to the DC GG meetup, if s/he really wants to understand the ""sides"" here. This might actually spook them further! But at the very least, it would help them understand the parties that are currently embroiled in a conflict on their turf.  That's the most important part to ken. There *is* a conflict. This venue *is* a current hot zone. They have *already* acted. The DC lesson is that ""anti-GG"" will call and harass and act atrociously, even going so far as to call in the police. But all you gotta do, to do the right thing (and make bank) is steady on, and refuse to bend to threats and harassment. The cooler heads here are the right heads. There are a small, dedicated number of lunatics who are probably behind the brigading of the venue. They'll gnash and chomp and yell and scream, especially if they don't get their way. The DC bar owner said ""Fuck that, this is America, kiss my ass, you lunatics."" And everything went well. Not perfect, but okay.  These folks here are going to prevail. It's already happening, with prominent figures who were against them dropping out of the fight. B&amp;B can help that along. Nothing bad will happen to them if they don't, but they'll probably end up feeling foolish, and losing a bit of money.  (also also, ""pubic pressure, huh huh, huh huh"")",,1433134735,0,t1_crranbl

Esperanto communities evolved around Esperanto. If the thought of a constructed language with Esperanto's properties and communities based on the language and it's properties doesn't thrill you, there is no point in studying.  Like, they have something like a travel network where you can couch surf at Esperantists' (that's how they call themselves, right?) homes and stuff. And they have online communities. And they usually translate a lot of stuff to Esperanto.  But most of the Esperanto speakers are from western countries. So you won't get a truly new cultural experience. You also won't get that experience where you just walk up to somebody you met, talk in their language to them and start a conversation like that. If you do that in Esperanto, people will just look weird at you because almost nobody speaks it.  So if you care for any of those things, Esperanto is not your target language. You learn Esperanto for the sake of Esperanto and communities based on Esperanto.  It's also a very easy language for Europeans so you don't actually need to invest as much time into Esperanto as you'd have to invest into most other languages.  Edit: In the same way the link about Esperanto native speakers has been posted three times already, somebody will probably also post something about original Esperanto cultural output. Important to note here is that everything is relative. Compared to any other naturally developed language, Esperanto has virtually no native speakers and virtually no cultural output. You could learn Icelandic or Luxembourgerish and end up with more of both even though most people don't even know Luxembourg has it's own language and most people will only guess that Icelandic is a language correctly in the same way they guess wrongly that Belgians speak Belgian.",,1433122172,0,t3_37zmhz

Therefore, an individual who willingly performs suicide for religious reasons cannot, in my opinion, be classified as a martyr by the simple fact that a third party did not directly cause their death (influence =/= cause, for all the smartasses out there).    As such, the suicide bomber is not a martyr because he was the direct cause of his own death.

No. That's moral objectivism. Immanuel Kant was a moral realist without being a moral objectivist. However, his particular brand of ""subjectivism"" since it asserted that morality was both universal and absolute, would be called objective morality by most people, so this is admittedly a somewhat academic/technical distinction. Even though Lewis said ""subjectivism"" all the time, I think what he really meant was what we would call moral anti-realism.  &gt; You can have morality without objective morality.  But you can't have morality without having real morality.  &gt; Relativity, for example, doesn't argue that there is no right and wrong  No. Relativity is an idea in physics developed by Einstein. Moral relativism, which is completely unrelated, is the claim that no moral ideas are actually true, and it differs from nihilism only in that moral nihilism is more thought-out.  &gt; First of all, if these moral positions are logically defensible, then you should stop evaluating them based on how well they fit with your own moral system.  Why?  &gt; And moral realism has plenty of blood on its hands, so stop insinuating that anti-realism is crazy and evil and moral realism is the harbinger of virtue.  Moral anti-realism is crazy and moral realism is a prerequisite for basic sanity. It is necessary but not sufficient to qualify as a sane person.  &gt; And God, if we never thought critically about morality, we'd still be whipping our slaves and sending children into mines.  Only moral realism can provide grounds to justify the claim that either of those things were ever wrong.",,1433134475,0,t1_crr7qv1

I was an admin in a fan forum (Silent Hill, no less!) and while it just died instead of overcrowding, I did see the same thing in a small scale. A very similar (most of the oldest members were the same ones) dedicated to glorious Kojima and his games sadly did overgrow and admin + mods kind of tapped out and let it go to shit. It will happen to TiA too. If shit hits the fan bad enough, no amount of volunteer mods can take it after a certain point.  It's an internet-wide phenomenon. The crazy of SJW infecting everything nowadays surely doesn't help.  Oh, all most forgot. I moderated a nationwide ISP's forums and Facebook account at one point. I just have to say, that those things were in their own league altogether. Shit was insane. Atleast TiA doesn't have paying customers *(shudder)*, so we have that going for us at least. It was kept   together by a dedicated social media team which consisted of about 10 employees at any given time. The user base size was comparable to TiA in it's current state.  Edit: /r/Tumblrpls was the one, as some have mentioned here already.  Edit 2: I have to know. Who are the people lurking TiAD and downvoting random posts without any explanation? Goddamnit, even OP's? Reddiquette, people, remember what that was?",,1433138389,0,t3_380dbw

The main focus of JWs is very simple: To help people understand the Bible and to draw close to God. Many Christian churches and sects teach false practices that come from man, rather than from God. One such example of this is Hell. Many churches teach that if you sin, you will go to hell and to be tortured forever. Unless, of course, you give us money! Many false teachings like this have arisen over the years for various purposes, both malicious and innocent. We know that this is not what God intends for us though. For more information on that, view here: http://bit.ly/1HF1wtY  How does it work on this problem?  First comes a great deal of study among JWs. We have 2 meetings a week which last 2 hours. We are heavily encouraged to study ahead for these meetings in advance. This allows all to come together and participate in open discussion, and for everyone to get their knowledge directly from the bible, instead of one individual.  Next comes our door to door ministry. This is also where we get the majority of our stigma. In the Bible, Jesus commanded his disciples to go door to door and ""spread the good news of the kingdom"". So, sorry to everyone who may dislike JWs for our ministry work!!! But, Jesus commanded us, and it's a commandment we take very seriously. More information on that here: http://bit.ly/Lo5P6T  And lastly is our free in home bible studies. The ultimate goal of our door to door work is to start studies. We come to the homes of those interested, or meet in a public place. We then use a study guide, and study through the major points of the bible with the individuals. All of these things; the studying, the door to door, and the bible studies are all free. All of it is on a volunteer basis. We do it solely because we care about all peoples and want to share our knowledge of the Bible with them.  Who is someone who you can view as a model of someone who perfectly worships as a Jehovah's Witness?  Any of the faithful individuals in the Bible are prime examples. If you want someone living, there is no one I can name that you would know of. Anyone can fit this description, though. You yourself could easily fit it tomorrow if you wished.  The overall end-goal is not Heaven for us. The Bible states that only 144,000 individuals will go to heaven from the Earth. It also talks about a ""large crowd"" of people that is without number that will inherit a paradise Earth. I'm really bad at explaining things, so I'm once again going to just link you to JW.org : )   Read here: http://bit.ly/1K38EFt  How have Jehovah's Witnesses been active in modern day current events? What are they involved in?  We do not get involved in secular events. We are prohibited from voting, or taking part in wars. We are not patriotic, as our loyalties lie solely in God. The most active events we have are our ministry, and our annual conventions : )   Hope I was of some help. I was most likely horribly inadequate in my answers, so please check jw.org for anything else you need to know!",,0,0,t3_37vekg

The 3 to kill thing is deceptive, you need to be fully buffed with SS and Adlo for the 3rd one. I rarely die to LBs, however when I do there is literally nothing I can do about it. That's the big issue, the LB button is a ""click button, get kills"". There is no amount of skill that can prevent some of the LB kills if 2 BLM just sync up their meteors. You can't pop reactionary abilities against it, and you can't just run out either due to the server lag.  The best LB was how it is in Secure, where you can't do more than one LB, and the insta-kill ones were slow enough for a player counter-reaction. I think the cometeor just needs an overlap change, where they can't stack.  &gt; I have Melees in my GC that goes 15-0  I never said Melees were bad, just that casters are too good. I've seen BLMs go 20+ kills consistently. You can't deny that meeles are disadvantaged in the 72-man fight though. I can usually pick off a battle high melee with ease. A single team with 4 skilled BLMs can carry the entire alliance, whereas a single team with 4 skilled Melees might get a net positive in kills but won't single handedly cause a win.",,0,0,t1_crr0hfy

I started out by making peace with Provence by releasing Guyenne, Normany and returning Calais to Burgandy. This got Provence out of the war and removed any free warscore France would receive from occupation and any War Exhaustion from those sources.   After that I just evacuated my exiled troops to the mainland and reduced to my new force limit. I took the mission Vassalize Scotland and started with claims on the Irish Minors. I declared war on Scotland and immediately took them out, vassalizing them since they had no allies. I took my time declaring war on each Irish Minor and gave them to Scotland so that I would not have to deal with them.   At this time the War of the Roses fired and I choose the best king and almost immediately ended it by killing the one Rebel stack that came about and put myself to 1 stability. Waited for an heir which did not take long. At this time I had positive stability and a good King instead of the shit one I started with.  The next move was to get my relations with Burgandy and Spain up since they had me rivaled. After max relations I just waited for Burgandy to declare on France, which they hated much more, when they did I marched back into France and carpet sieged France after their manpower was gone. Enforce PU, profit. The trick was keeping France under the PU after that war because Castile was not going to be my friend. I managed so far.",,0,0,t1_crr8o31

The world of the witcher is incredibly complex with seep social and political issues.  everything has a reason and its all thoroughly explained.  The witcher series is one of the best written in all of gaming.  It treats players as adults and doesnt fall victim to cheese like say...a bioware RPG.  The fact that they are attacking it and what they are saying shows perfectly well that they have never played a single game in the series and are just basing this vitriol on a quick video they saw or some comments they read online.  How about you play a game for once?  I hate having to straight up call these two idiots but...they are idiots.  Wait...maybe they aren't idiots.

Thats pretty much hitting it on the head, and what I need to fix.  I had so much I wanted to do with her and would be upset when we never did it, but looking back on it I never put any effort into planning or coming up with ideas, so my being upset about it wasnt justified at all.

I'm not sure how you have him so far down this list of ""issues"" -- middle relief *is* an issue and he along with Carpenter are the two major culprits.    &gt;So basically what I'm saying is that I'm not going to stress over what is essentially the last (or second to last) guy out of the bullpen   He's second in the majors in IP and he hasn't been exclusively pitching in garbage time.   &gt;and he's been adequate when he's in (his ERA is ~4.30 this month outside the Texas disaster).   Again, his numbers were trending the wrong way (that's not ignoring the fact a ~4.3ERA for a reliever is pretty bad); career trend suggest he wasn't as good as his April numbers indicated.

Someone should never be shamed for not knowing something and attempting to learn by asking. He didn't know and he asked a community of people that get together for the purpose of asking questions in an open, non-judgmental atmosphere.  It's a free country and you can insult anyone you want, but I guarantee more people will think less of you for it than they would of the guy that wanted to learn something.  Edit- one other thought. It's really not that basic of knowledge. Of course everyone knows that women bleed monthly, but I know that before I got my period, I wouldn't have known if you could just squeeze it all out. How much do you know about how it feels to urinate and stop the flow for a guy and all that? How much do you know about what happens to the urine in their dick when they stop peeing? Sure we might have assumptions, but if you don't ask, that's all it is. This guy was trying to get accurate information. He wasn't trying to spread false information or doing anything malicious. Just trying to learn.  Also, I would disagree that this is extremely common knowledge. Of course everyone knows that women bleed, but I would hazard a guess that most guys don't know the specifics of how it works and what it feels like, because most guys don't care. That guy actually took the time to wonder about a woman and try to learn how it works for them. He should be commended for trying to learn something rather than insulted for not knowing it in the first place.  I mean, this works for anything, really. If someone asked you why the sky was blue, or why cats have whiskers, or why are testicles on the outside... Should you make fun of them for it, or help them learn something?

If we sell our home and split the profit, neither one of us can life in the area. We live in an awesome upper middle class neighborhood that was a buyers market when we purchased our home.  Our daughter would have to switch schools if we sell.  At this point, my wife IS NOT my friend, I don't care to hang out with her, I don't care to even talk to her.   You talk about being too old?

Expanding on that:  One Samuel Wilson -- known as ""Uncle Sam"" -- and his brother Ebeneezer had a contract to supply the U.S. Army forces in New Jersey &amp; New York with meat during part of the War of 1812. The packages of meat were marked ""U.S."", referring to the United States.  The above is known to be true. Going along with this is a story that is well known, but difficult to verify: when soldiers saw ""U.S."" stamped on the packages, those that knew the Wilson brothers joked that the initials ""U.S."" actually stood for ""Uncle Sam"". Over the years, this became a common army joke: anything supplied by the government was said to be from Uncle Sam.  Regardless of whether the above is 100% correct, ""Uncle Sam"" did end up being a popular personification of the U.S. government in the 1800s.  In WWI, the image of Uncle Sam, dressed in red, white, and blue, was used in army recruiting, most famously in [this poster](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Unclesamwantyou.jpg), which was painted in 1917. The poster became very well known and resulted in Uncle Sam having a standard, recognized appearance. Before WWI, people knew what ""Uncle Sam"" referred to, but there was no particular way he was expected to look.  ----  By the way, the above recruitment poster was inspired by a similar [poster from Britain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Kitchener-leete.jpg), painted in 1914, which showed a real person: Lord Herbert Kitchener, British Secretary of State for War 1914-1916.",,1433186370,0,t1_crraymo

Think of it this way: she's the owner of a small company. You are the part time worker who comes in. When you are in, she feels the need to supervise. She lives and breathes this business 24/7. Of course she's not going to take you up on a few offers to look after things while she goes out. The thing is, you're both owners of the business - you bring in the money 8 hours a day. But please understand that you then have the other 16 hours which you need to invest in the 'business'.  If you take two 3-4 hour activities a week, then you need to be absolutely ON for the rest of the time. I mean, if I was tired, stressed and generally feeling shit, my partner wouldn't dream of disappearing for three hours and leaving me to deal with something as stressful as a baby. She's moved out. If you want a chance at fixing this then you need to present her with options. Can you work part time while she also goes back to work? Split the care and chores 50/50? If not, can you both go to a therapist and look at what the grievances are, and how to fairly set some expectations? If you think this is possible, then the onus is on you. Find a few therapists, ask your wife to come to one. If she doesn't want to choose one, then you pick. Organise someone to watch the baby - if you choose family, then sort out a backup babysitting service so they can't back out. Go to therapy and LISTEN. It can get better, but it looks like you need to readjust your views on how hard her life actually is. However, having said that - do not give up your bike rides. Cut them down - 1 hour twice a week is much more palatable. But please don't give up the exercise completely. You have a right to good health, both physical and mental.",,0,0,t3_37zcow

In both, there are mentions of what characters have done prior to the apocalypse, implying it occurred in their lifetime, and likely at some point during their adulthood.  I thought what was implied by the original Mad Max trilogy was that not all of the world was as hopelessly destroyed in the apocalypse as the wastes surrounding the Refinery or Bartertown.  We see in Mad Max that he lives and works in a remaining civilized and relatively untouched area of Australia. After Max's family is killed, he flees from this, and finally ends up deeper into Australia, or even on the other side of the continent - closer to the East coast, where it would make sense for more nuclear attacks to have been targeted, meaning more destruction, and where it would also make sense that there were the relatively large amounts of people we see in Road Warrior and Thunderdome. This would also explain the relatively small (And very likely under-fueled) plane that the Captain Walker tribe and the Gyrocaptain making it to such a large city before having to land.  In the aftermath of such an obviously destructive war, it would undoubtedly be decades or even generations, before the civilized and relatively untouched areas of Australia and/or the world, were recovered enough and able to expend the manpower and resources to reach back out to the untamed wastes -  and such an expansion would obviously be slowed by the inevitable warfare with the local tribes, clans, and city-states that have arisen in the meantime.  I haven't seen Fury Road, yet, though, so I can't comment on how its story affects this.

We're not really working with any kind of ""tangled knot"" here. You're just misunderstanding some basic concepts. For one thing, God is not spoken of as being ""formed of three separate entities."" As I've explained elsewhere in this discussion, the Trinity is a single divine nature hypostatized in three different ways that are differentiated relationally. The three hypostases don't ""form"" God (God is not the Father + the Son + the Spirit), nor are they ""wholly different"" from one another (all difference is strictly relational, at the hypostatic level, a matter of their manner of hypostatizing the nature--one God existing in three different ways).  Historically speaking, Christian discourse prioritizes the first hypostasis, the Father. When early Christians talk about God, they mainly mean the Father. They also believed that the Son was in some way a revelation of the Father, and hence ""God"" in some sense, but the Father has priority in Christian discourse because he has priority in the history of revelation and the economy of salvation. We know of the Father first, and we know of Christ as the one who was sent by the Father to reveal the will of the Father. (Of course, that also complicates things, because even though we know of the Father first, post-Christ is now becomes the case that we know of the Father *through the Son*, and so, in that sense, Christ takes priority in Christian theology; he becomes the starting point of our God-talk.) Christian theologians saw this historical relationship between Father and Son--that of the Sender and the One Sent, the Revealed One and the Revealer--as telling us something about the eternal nature of God, and so we develop the idea that, *from eternity*, there's some kind of ""ordering"" within the life of the Trinity. That's not *ontological subordination*--the Son is not of a different, lesser substance from the Father--but merely a matter of their eternal hypostatic relations. The Father and Son play different roles in the Triune life, and the Father's role is in some sense ""prior to"" or ""more fundamental than"" that of the Son.  For some--e.g., for those who, as I mentioned, have been willing to talk of the Father as the Son's own ""God""--the revelation that happens for us in the economy of salvation is just an extension of something that happens eternally in and for the Trinity itself. That is, Trinitarian life is a process of divine self-revelation and self-knowledge, in which the *personhood* of God is actualized tri-personally. If to be a person is to be a subject subjectivizing the object content of one's being, then for God, that process occurs tripersonally. That is to say, the Son is the Logos, the ""Word"" or eternal content of God hypostatized; but in the eternal ordering of the Trinity, he is the Word of *the Father*. In other words, the Father, as God, knows his own divinity in the Son, and the Son, as the eternal divine content of the Father, knows his own content as *the Father's*, not as his own. Which is to say that the Aristotelian ideal of God as eternally contemplating his own perfection is broken down and reworked in relational terms: God, the Father, contemplates and loves his own perfect divinity *in another*, since he has handed it all over to the Son, and the Son, to whom this content has been handed over, effaces himself before the Father as his God. For this to work at all, the Son must actually be the Word of the Father; he must actually possess the Father's own divinity and ontologically co-equal with the Father.  Not really a tangled knot to me. To say that the Father is the Son's God is precisely to say that the Son himself eternally God. Is it complicated? Sure. But a theology that isn't complicated is a theology that isn't worth anyone's time.",,0,0,t1_crra6sn

There should also be things like the ships and horse rental that take place in real time but are faster than walking.

I'll be frank: I think you're being disingenuous. I think you're comparing apples and oranges by asking why neither is an onion. I think you can readily acknowledge that the two parties disagree on plenty of issues. I think that your concern isn't with similarities between the Democratic and Republican parties. I think your concern is, instead, with the general notion that libertarian policies are not well-represented among the two major parties.  That's largely because libertarian political philosophy is essentially dead in the water. It doesn't have a history of successful policy implementation behind it (even on a micro level), and there has never been a modern libertarian government anywhere on the planet (in fact, the nations that tend to rank highest in the world on indices of democratic freedoms are typically Social Democracies). Many of its underpinnings are considered unfounded by modern economists, and it's pretty tough to mount a moral defense of libertarianism without coming across as simultaneously naive and heartless. Put simply, libertarianism just isn't tenable.  So if ""The two parties are identical!"" is actually code for ""My personal beliefs aren't well-represented!"" then, well, yes, I'll agree with you. They aren't well-represented at all. It may be time for you to take another hard look at figuring out why libertarianism, as a governing philosophy, isn't taken seriously.

BUT, if you, like me a while ago, have no time, money or simply don't care enough to get a test kit, go for the popular methods:   * The Taste Test. If it's bitter and/or metallic and/or numb your tongue, it's most likely a RC;  * Other method is using a black light. Expose your tabs to black light, if it glows it's most likely LSD, but this could possibly damage your tabs;  * Swallow the tab instead of keeping it on your tongue. Since most RCs are absorbed sublingually, swallowing it will prevent you from tripping on something that's not LSD. Keep it in mind that I don't endorse this, since i've heard that some RCs *are* absorbed in your stomach. (I don't know if this is true, source is needed).  As I said before, without using a test kit, you can never be 100% sure about it. What you can do though, is not be stupid about it, in case you decide not to get one. *Stay safe :)*",,0,0,t3_380ewq

Even though that may be somewhat different than this, in Turkey you're not allowed to insult Atatürk and the West has criticized Turkey for how wrong that is and all that bullshit. Really, the Western society is far from perfect, freedom of speech is actually a weak aspect of many European countries. The US is doing a lot better than most.  Edit: Apparently she got expelled from her party, and not because what she did is illegal. Still, it is a remaining fact that many European countries have laws that make it illegal to deny the supposed Armenian genocide, and that is just sad. That is disrespecting freedom of speech.

It's also risky if you fought, are low and the enemy is respawning and catches you at boss.  The best thing to do is secure an XP advantage with the curse to make grabbing mercs, more tributes and playing aggressively easier. And the single easiest way to get XP during a curse is to push a fort. I see people are saying ""well you don't have an advantage so it's not worth"" which is wrong for a few reasons. First, you probably won a fight for the tribute in which case forts go down fast. However, if you had to back or the enemy gave you a free tribute then you still have minions, usually at least 1.5 waves by the time they hit the nearest fort. Minions actually hurt quite a bit in a fight and can add up to the damage of another hero if not respected. Besides that, you don't HAVE to fight. Sit there threatening their base and let your minions do work in the other 2 lanes if you're afraid of getting caught. If they sent someone to tend to the waves, great it's a 4v5 and usually an easy fight and fort. Secondly, the enemy is in tight chokes by their fort if they want to save it while you are in an open area, making big ultimates and strong zoning skills much more intimidating. If you really can't find an opening and somehow the enemy avoids the curse altogether, then you can easily retreat and grab mercs with 20-30 seconds left on the curse while the enemy does some creep cleaning.  By doing mercs right away you sacrifice a lot for something you could've done anyways. The mercs can be used after the curse for almost equal pressure as they apply during curse, but if timed right can create the pressure during an objective spawn and forces the enemy into a tight spot. All of the mercs don't die easily to towers and kill forts on their own if no enemy tends to them, which is essentially what minions will do when the enemy is cursed. However if you get both you don't add much more pressure as a single hero with wave clear with get them both at the same time. Think about it this way: if you get the boss before an objective on any map you get 1 of 2 things. The enemy base dies to boss of they forfeit the objective. With boss and curse you get only the fort that you could be getting anyways by pushing as 5, but you have the option of boss after curse or as it is about to end and get another fort by pushing with boss. Secondly the minions with 1 HP die instantly and if you aren't around you are actually LOSING XP to the enemy. If they have everyone in a lane clearing waves and you are doing a merc camp the enemy can actually gain a lead on you and by the time the mercs get to a tower the curse is mostly over and the enemy is already in position to deal with them.  TL;DR don't do mercs, push and gain XP to make the rest of the game easier with a 2 level lead.",,0,0,t3_38042i

Doesn't have a name yet.  Been doing a lot of passive forcing. Got a job, so have less free time for active forcing. But I have lots of time for passive forcing. I visualize his form, talk to him, and just hang out with him.  Visualization: It's been improving. I have found it easier to see his form and face in my mind, in different positions and angles. When I have time for active forcing, I'll spend more time defining and clarifying his form.  Personality: I only specified a few traits while developing his personality. I'm considering ""adding"" a few more traits but I think I'll let it develop more naturally. His personality is already showing, it will be more defined over time.  Behavior: I have had a few ""conversations"" with him! He's not all that talkative but he will sometimes answer me. More often he'll show his feelings with body language.  Sentience: While he's there, I'm not sure if he's sentient yet. He takes his emotional cues from me. When I asked him his favorite color, I got back a garbled mess. In other words, he hasn't really surprised me yet.  I've also noticed that on days where I didn't get much sleep the night before, I have real trouble getting any response for him. Visualization and narration seem useless.  Anyway, you all seem like a bunch of crazy role players (friendly wink) but tulpas are super cool.  Pretty new to this community.

For a long time, linen and wool were the two main textile fabrics.  The market share of flax fabric has declined as other textile yarns became more available.  Silk replaced linen as the luxury clothing fabric in the Mediterranean either imported from China, or, after the Byzantines smuggled silkworms back to Europe, locally produced silk.  The next yarn to challenge linen and erode the market share of flax was cotton.  This was originally imported to Europe from India, but later (and more cheaply after the invention of the cotton gin) from the Southern USA, and then Egypt and other regions.  After that came a variety of synthetic fibers.  Flax is a fairly expensive crop to process into textiles (it has extra processes involved, such as ""retting"" that other fibers do not).  So, once linen was the main ""lighter"", ""smoother"", ""cooler"", ""stronger"" (which is why it was used to make sailcloth canvas) alternative to wool.  As other fibers were introduced, they were cheaper, they wrinkled less, and they gained market share.  Cotton canvas, for example, generally replaced flax canvas as sailcloth during the first half of the nineteenth century.  Eventually, flax fiber was only left with niche markets in textiles.  This reduced it's relative value as a crop and it became somewhat of a specialist market. ",,0,0,t3_38055j

Perhaps it is part of that alternate FTB account he made, and he's just confused how the community would betray what he thought they would be.

Personally for me TRU handled it the best and at stores that had a smaller stock of Greninja they did a ticket system so no one would be running.

Directives are not directly enforceable, only their national implementations are. With directives, if they are not implemented correctly your only recourse, if the national law can't be bent (""interpretation in conformity with the Directive"") or there is no national implementation at all, is to sue the member state. If you're a defendant, you go free or you're not liable (there was the famous Berlusconi case where his own government didn't implement a directive).   In some cases, the EU will legislate directly without directives to be implemented. These are EU laws called regulations and they have direct effect in member state courts. To avoid confusion, the member states can not have laws in any way deviating from the regulation. This is the most powerful tool of the EU legislative and is harder to pass and is supposed to be used with great care, especially in regards to subsidiarity.   The treaties themselves can sometimes have direct effect, as well, which is to say be directly enforceable in national courts of law. The ECJ is known to give various articles direct effect, even though no one expected them to have that; they've been accused of competence creep, which is to say trying to expand their own power and that of the EUs with tenuous support in the treaties. Some national judiciaries are somewhat sceptical of the ECJ. It was the ECJ who first claimed the supremacy of EU law over even national constitutions. As with so many other things, it was only later put into treaty. The German federal constitutional court only recently referred their first case ever to the ECJ for intepretation (the ECJ is supposed to elucidate on points of law in general terms when asked and not sentence directly, but they've taken to give such specific interpretations they essentially give the national courts no choice).   When you speak of privacy you might be thinking of the European Convention of Human Rights, which is older than and separate from the EU. There is also, more recently, the EU Charter which is somewhat similar but only applies in spheres where the EU has competence. The ECHR is more powerful for that reason as well as others. Whichever one of the ECHR, the Charter or the national law gives the strongest protection of individual rights - you could say the most ""strict"" - applies.   Human rights used to be separate from the EU, the EU wrote its own Charter so the national supreme and constitutional courts couldn't say the EU had insufficient protection of rights whereas they did. So that's why we have both the Charter and the ECHR. The EU, as an institution, is supposed to join the ECHR as well, but it has proved somewhat complex since, well, the EU isn't a nation, and I haven't followed whatever progress that might have been made in recent years too closely. The ECHR has become EU law though, but again, only where the EU has competence. So you're better off going to the ECHR. You can appeal a case to the ECtHR directly when you've extinguished your national remedies, which isn't possible with the ECJ (ECtHR as in European *Court* of Human Rights, to distinguish from ECHR which is the *Convention*).  So uh, I hope that makes as much sense as possible. Any questions just ask and I'll answer the best I can. ",,1433120746,0,t1_crr91q7

These are abstract concepts. Science can only talk about measured behavior or anatomy of the brain and all the things that correlate between them.  Thinking is to the brain what digestion is the the stomach. How can we argue the resulting abstract emergent phenomena of consciousness is this or that? It won't always be black and white. Many times we operate off of assumptions and common sense to make ethical decisions. Why? Because sometimes they work better than consulting our incomplete knowledge, studies, diagrams, and textbooks.   **Why not eat meat?** The burden of proof is convincing the other person. You are saying you will only be convinced by information that hasn't been presented to you yet. I am making the argument that this other information, and yes emotions, should be listened to and fully processed before you make the decision to eat meat. That's all, a bid for attention/focus. It is a social norm to have discussions in this manner.   About veggies...Vegetables don't have a nervous system, and they have not been shown to experience pain. I also don't have a sympathy for them the way I do naturally for animals. Their 'will' to reach the sunlight and soak up water is interesting, but I don't feel bad cutting that short. It doesn't intuitively feel as relatable as a cow's 'will' for affection as it nuzzles it's young and cuddles with humans and cries, etc.  **What ifs?** If the hypothetical 'what if' electrical and plant brain situation did happen. I might be similarly concerned. Yes, it would effect my decision making. If I found out tomorrow that there was reasonable evidence that every move I made hurt other people in an alternate universe, I would feel an ethically-charged tense anxiety for that too. However, we must deal with proof as it comes ( and in what incomplete form it comes), and luckily it's not hinting at anything that's absurdly horrible. The reality though is pigs are good at video games, chickens can count and chose to hug people, and other animals are proving new forms of intelligence all the time to scientists, and I gotta live with that if I ever choose to pay someone to slice one up.   The burden of proof is on both omnivores and non-omnivores, and I don't know what proof could ever be counted as actually 'definitive'. I'm just saying that I know enough about the mind of animals to not eat them. I don't know what you need to know about their minds to make you stop.  **About something you said to another redditor:** You used the same line of reasoning earlier when you said killing an animal is philosophically the same as swatting a fly or squishing a spider. Have you studied spider/fly brains? Can you confidently say that it is insignificant? If not, can you use it as an example for making an ethical decision about a life? You can't build an argument on other arguments that haven't been proven (that are just assumed to be true off-hand). That's why I mentioned the proving humans have feelings/intelligence thing. You are starting with the assumption that you can prove they do, but if you're wrong, and you can't...How can you prove that animals have it or don't?

The biggest change I made to improve this was to bike at a different cadence.  So my legs were moving faster instead of pushing hard.  To the point where it is not quite what you want to do naturally.  When I ride like this, my knees feel much, much better.  This isn't the most natural way to ride so sometimes I'll ride with a slower cadence if I'm trying to focus on time.  My knees will usually end up sore, and if I ride the next day, even if I'm doing everything right, things like climbing hills will hurt a lot more than they usually do.  My point is that the ascent isn't what's causing the soreness, it's the improper ride the day before.  Also the saddle height thing.  I too have put mine higher than I should a time or two and dropping it down an inch helped.  Third, reduce your resistance by making sure your tires are properly inflated and all your moving parts are in order.  I think it's starting from a stop that does it the worst and those things are made worse by improper tuning.  Lastly, no matter how well I'm doing, after a week or so of constant riding and other strain on the knees, sometimes I just need a rest day.",,0,0,t3_37uftf

Anyway, like 2 years after the burn I noticed this great big red/pink bump right in the middle of where the burn was. Oshitskincancer.   Freak the fuck out, go to family doctor, he freaks the fuck out telling me it looks like it might be cancer and sends me to a skin cancer doctor. Skin Cancer doctor freaks the fuck out saying it looks like that really shitty kind of skin cancer that fucks you up real bad. I'm rushed to an oporating room where they freeze my leg and slice the bump out, it had a root or something, it was only about as round as a pencil eraser but was almost an inch long. Hurt like a bitch when my leg got unfrozen. They send the cancery  pencil eraser thing to a lab in Ontario. The cancer doctor said she was almost certain it was cancer but they need some kind of proof by looking at the cells or some shit before she can autherize further cutting. She told me they'd need to cut out a chunk of my leg as deep as the thing they cut out for about 2 inches around the hole, it sounded fairly unpleasant.   Few weeks later and results came back. Turns out it was a false alarm, some kind of weird ass rare mole type thing, apparantly the sunburn *did* cause it but it was nothing to worry about. Cancer doctor just said ""huh, never heard of that before but whatever"" and told me to go buy some sun screen and not worry about it.   So, it may have been a false alarm, but it was still a warning. The sun can apparantly do all kinds of weird shit to your skin, might not even be cancer but it's still going to suck ass. Now I have this gross hole scar thing in the middle of my ugly burnt ass knee and now I feel uncomfortable wearing shorts in the summer, I have to wear those gay ass looking pants that aren't really pants but still not shorts because they stop like half way up your shin, if I do wear normal shorts I get kids asking me why my leg looks all fucky.",,0,0,t1_crqxgyr

Marriage is recognized by governments because they have an interest in it: namely, they wish that their nation's population not die out, but produce new generations continually. Marriage provides a means for a man and woman to enter into a unique bond for life for the purpose of raising a family (which entails procreation).  How is it that two men or two women are to procreate? It is biologically impossible. For this very reason, same-sex marriage does not compare to interracial marriage, as some have argued, for race in no wise precludes the object of procreation, as does sex.  Moreover, it is *not*, as you suggest, discriminatory not to recognize same-sex marriages. A homosexual man can marry any woman he pleases, with equal freedom as a heterosexual man. We are not preventing him from entering into such a bond for the purpose of creating a family (although we might privately ponder the wisdom of a marriage in which there is no physical attraction). We do not recognize same-sex 'marriage' as marriage in the same way that we do not recognize a refrigerator as a toaster oven: it lacks that essential function of procreation, as a refrigerator lacks that essential function of toasting.  And if anyone seeks to challenge my inclusion of the potential for procreation into my definition of *marriage*, then I  should like him to tell me what is the usefulness of distinguishing between civil unions and marriages (on this matter, I am opposed to recognition of same-sex civil unions on theological grounds, but not on purely secular grounds).",,0,1,t3_3806pz

I was always the nerdy type, so getting me to educate myself for the last month or so wasn't too difficult. I enjoyed it, so my parents decided to let me continue.   It was awesome. I could sleep in and then spend my morning at the library, a park, or a cafe doing homework, then pop back home in time for an online class or to go through a text book with one of my parents. Because I had few time constraints, I could focus on my cello studies and figure skating throughout the day instead of all at once. My dad's office was just a few blocks away, so I often accompanied him to work and learned basic bookkeeping/accounting.   The best part, though, was the academic freedom I was afforded. I fell hard for linguistics, history, and writing, and my parents told me that as long as I kept up my grades in whatever math or science course I was in at the time, I could study whatever I felt like. I ended up learning French and Mandarin during that time, which opened so many doors to me down the road. Eventually my mom wanted to go back to work and my dad felt out of his area of expertise, so my siblings and I went back to school for my 10th grade year. The next three years were absolutely monotonous, and I would not experience that sort of academic freedom until college. As well as it worked out for me and my brothers (I have a BA in anthropology and am in a grad program for nursing; one brother is an engineer, the other is about to graduate high school),  it doesn't always work out quite as well for everyone else. I encountered a handful of the awkward homeschool types at the different conventions and clubs I participated in, and felt horrible for them. For the most part, though, the kids were just smart individuals who didn't thrive in a traditional schooling environment. ",,0,0,t3_38036b

Like, I've seen bans for not keeping voice chat to trades only when there is literally nobody trading, which is pretty stupid if you ask me. Also, if you have a plugin that breaks, expect people to abuse it, and if it is broken, AT MOST give out 30 min bans for abusing it, because nobody should be permanently banned for accidentally abusing a plugin when it is the server's responsibility to keep the plugins running!

We already have equally as devastating weapons that don't have nearly the same bill of side-effects as using a nuclear weapon. Practically all of the fun without the risk of enduring hotspots of radiation, massive fluctuations of energy tearing apart the delicate natural state on Earth, and the spread of fallout.  The endgame of any global conflict was and will never be the end of the planet, but the goal of global domination.  What World War III will likely be is a Unification War. The final step of pushing the world towards a globally unified force.  It comes up a lot in fiction and I think there's good reason for it. People have a tendency to drastically change after massive conflict. World War III will be setting the stage for a power like the UNSC, as a noteable example in fiction, being established as a far more powerful version of the League of Nations or the United Nations in an effort to control the planet even if it means using extreme force. There would be no more room for pandering in a diplomatic sense after WWIII, action and enforcement will be the rulers of the day.",,1433117943,0,t3_37yd9i

If you ""lose"" a phone (or any other item) that you've insured, you first of all have to provide the insurance company with a police report documenting the loss.  Filing a false police report is a criminal matter, and you're facing a pretty big risk just to get a free phone.  Secondly, when you make a claim on your insurance, this can affect your insurance premiums.  If you start making claims, you're considered a bigger risk, and depending on the company, they may start charging you more.  Finally, insurance companies do have deductibles -- if the phone you lost is worth $300, you may be required to pay a $50 deductible before they replace it.   If you replace a phone under warranty, as the previous poster mentioned, they'll take your information and create a record.

You will complete the main story quests of your Alliance (to get to level 49) and then from VR1-5 you will do the quests from another Alliance and then from VR6-10 you do the quests from the last Alliance (the order changes based on your initial Alliance). Then you will probably head to Craglorn which is like a group zone where there are group quests.  If you are not into questing then it is a long and somewhat tedious time to get to Veteran Rank 14. This is what most people dislike about the Veteran Ranks (along with having to do all the other Alliance quests and the lack of character progression in this time).  Each Veteran Rank increase now gives you a Skill Point and an Attribute Point like the other levels.  Also when your reach Veteran Rank 1 then all of the XP you gain after that also contributes to the Champion System (more info [here](http://esoacademy.com/champion-system/)) and this gives you points to spend in small passive bonuses to your character stats. There are lots of Champion passives available under three constellations that increase things from Crit to blcking and everything else. There are diminishing returns on these passives, so the first point might be 1% Crit and the next is 0.8% and then next 0.6% and so on.

A solid state drive would massively speed up your system in general, it would make no difference for gaming FPS or rendering speed for example. However just for general use, a SSD is many thousand times faster than a spinning hard drive at random read/writes so the system would be so much more responsive and faster loading.  I would say Yosemite should have no problems with a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo and Geforce 320M on this Macbook. As for the RAM situation, 4GB at the moment is fine even for Yosemite. For example, the 2015 Macbook Air still only has 4GB of soldered RAM. But sooner or later, you'll probably need more RAM, especially with OS X 10.11 coming up. So I'd say go for the SSD first and then 8GB RAM if you have the money or do it later. I wouldn't bother with 16GB as I think the 2010 Macbook can only handle so much, unless your usage involved a lot of RAM usage like VMs.  TL;DR: Upgrade to SSD, maybe upgrade RAM to 8GB, clean Yosemite install and it'll feel like a whole new system.

Like there was a case in Colorado a couple years ago where a woman, about age 40 and a mom of 2 kids, went to her neighbor's door, after he'd asked her to come over. He was angry because she had a loud party and he wanted to discuss it. He then shot her 7 times at point blank range after she knocked at the door. She died almost immediately. He then claimed she said to him that she had a gun and had come over there to kill him with it, and that she was reaching for her gun, so he had no choice but to kill her before she killed him. No gun was found on her, and that she would have said what he claimed is, frankly, dubious. You get the feeling reading the district attorney's statement that he felt a guy had just gotten away with murder by engineering circumstances that would make his killing of her look like self defense, and that he was lying about her ever claiming that she had a gun and was about to kill him with it.  But there was no way prove she didn't say what he said she said, and the attorney general knew no jury would convict him, so he went free, no trial even.  Then, there's the case of Marissa Alexander in Florida. Marissa, a black woman, was threatened by her soon-to-be-ex-husband, who had a history of abusing her. She had just given birth a few days earlier. She pulled out a gun and fired a warning shot to the side, not at him. She was then arrested and got 20 years in jail because that is the minimum sentence for firing a gun under those circumstances. A few years later, Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was taking a walk to get some snacks and talking on the phone with a friend, was killed by a man (George Zimmerman) who felt he was a threat, and the man wasn't charged with anything. Then there was a big public outcry, and he was charged with a crime but was found not guilty. There was then also a big outcry about Marissa Alexander's sentencing in the face of the way Trayvon Martin's case went. Ultimately, she was retried and still found guilty, but got a lesser sentence.  And there's the case of Yoshihiro Hattori, a 15 year old Japanese exchange student who was murdered due to knocking on the wrong door. He was going to a Halloween party and had the address wrong, and knocked at the wrong door. When the owner slammed the door, Hattori walked away. But the owner was just going to get his gun. He then called to the boy walking away, causing him to turn around and start to approach, and he then shot and killed him. He was not charged because he was seen as defending his home, even though it was someone who was clearly not a threat, and who had been leaving. After a big outcry, he ended up standing trial, and was found not guilty. That was in Louisiana. So chances are, if you claim you felt threatened, even if you weren't at all threatened, you'll get off, most likely without trial, in certain states.",,0,0,t3_37ybdg

Any arisen phenomena whatsoever will change and cease it's form. Notice that all arisen/born phenomena do so based on other causes and conditions. Nothing exists without the support of something else. As obliviron mentioned, it's all due to cause and effect.   The Buddha was the best example in regards to dealing with death. When news was brought to him about the death of his best student, Sariputta, he had to remind other students about the impermanence of anything born. It's impossible for something sprung into existence to not decay and cease, and to wish for it would be an effort doomed to failure. Likewise when the Buddha was dying he said that many devas (aka spirits in the heavens) came to visit him. You couldn't fit a hair between their shoulders he said, and some were weeping and claiming it was too soon, while others maintained composure and understanding of impermanence (just like we buddhists do). In this way you can see them display similar qualities to our own.   The Buddha taught that within samsara (the cycle of birth, aging and death), there are 31 realms of existence. He was able to gain knowledge of them, their cause and their cessation through his awakening, his release from the cycle of birth, aging and death.   The human realm is the fifth lowest realm. All realms below us are realms of deprivation, where suffering is gross (profound). These realms in descending order are demons, ghosts, animal (only one we as humans can see) and hell. Keep in mind that one's time within any realm is impermanent. All of the realms above the human are considered the 'heavens'. Suffering is very limited (often comes in the form of change or disatisfaction) and pleasures are abundant. But regardless of whatever realm one is in, the three marks of existence persist.       all conditioned phenomena are inconstant     all conditioned phenomena are dukkha (stress/suffering)     all things (not just conditioned) are not-self.   Beings, even the highest brahmas in the heavens are still bound by conceit (self), otherwise they wouldn't still be bound by samsara (the cycle of birth, aging and death).   As for what is reborn, this is a difficult concept to understand but it is open and evident if you properly investigate it. The Buddha taught not to think of it in terms of 'who' but what. When there is birth, why? Because of becoming. When there is becoming, why? Because of clinging. When there is clinging, why? Because of craving. This step-by-step method is how the Buddha teaches all of the dhamma, every step, and this is why the teachings of the Buddha are so effective. They are missed out by the scientific community because one needs to put them into practice for one self, they are not to be intellectually grasped (although the Buddha was unsurpassed in leading one's mind in the right direction).   http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html  Beings are reborn in different realms due to their action. Typically killing, stealing, violence, harsh speech, etc. are unskillful as they bring one to destinations of deprivation, whether in this very life or after death. The opposite is for non-killing, non-stealing, non-violence, right speech, etc. These are skillful as they bring one to destinations of pleasure (pleasure being free from suffering). ",,0,0,t3_380gwm

I don't think most people would consider him elite at this point in his career. He is a solid QB with a stacked team. Any solid (not necessarily elite) QB with a stacked team has a shot at the Super Bowl, as does Tannehill. Look at Wilson's numbers. He is successful because of the team he is playing behind, not because he is ""elite"". Aaron Rodgers is elite, Peyton Manning is elite. Wilson very well may be on that list someday, but I don't think he's there yet.  TLDR; It doesn't take an elite QB to win a Super Bowl.",,0,0,t1_crrau4n

It's a hard thing to learn, but absolutely invaluable.  With school I would always create nightmare-like notesheets, that were 40% notes on what the teacher was saying and 60% nightmarish doodles spanning the entire page(Which eventually got me forced into an art class, but that's another story). The secret is that if you're incorporating what the teacher is talking about into your attempt to stave-off boredom, they'll usually let it fly - and You'd be surprised at what you remember!  If you don't need to be on task, it's sometimes fun to try and work-out some of the outcomes you see on your classmates. No one EVER makes a choice for no reason, there is always a motivation, and that can be a interesting rabbit hole to fall through.  Enjoy it while you can, and it'll be over before you know it. Don't procrastinate on homework(some teachers will even let you know the assignments early if you can weave some scheduling BS - they don't want you sleeping in class!), have friends, have fun, and take it easy.  School is a type of hell that's different then the hell of the rest of the world, and it's hard to enjoy... but these years you will remember and look back on some of the stupidest things.(Like that time the InfoTech teacher accidentally google-searched porn on the projector while looking for stock images).

There will likely be interim time between Dressrosa and a fight with a Yonko where the crew will get stronger. Specifically, I see crew members refining their abilities, gaining haki, and/or gaining greater mastery of their DFs. Specifically, I see Usopp learning to control his CoO from Sanji (who specializes in CoO), Chopper being able to use Monster Point longer and/or being able to move after using it,  and Luffy and Law awakening their DFs and refining their haki skills. Who knows what the rest of the crew will do to get stronger. Also, Jinbe will probably join at some point.  There's really no need for a time skip. The only possible timeskip I can see happening is that after Luffy finds One Piece, there's a timeskip to prepare for the final world encompassing war Whitebeard spoke of. ",,0,0,t3_37zkrz

Well, I say a lot... I could usually convince people that gaming was my job, given my logged hours, but I've actually been busy with proper grown-up stuff most of this week. :(   Still, Banished was how I spent the few hours that I did manage to set aside for gaming. When I first started with it, it was really annoying. I couldn't get enough food to my people, and they all ended up dying of age and leaving me with ghost towns, but I've since learnt how to use resource gathering buildings effectively, and plan housing properly. It reduces the absolute usable space in their zones, but getting cooperative buildings together in a little square in the centre of their circles, with a line of housing heading toward a hub with a market, where other resource collection villages branch off is a really good way of collecting all the food, wood, medicines, etc. and actually getting it to the villagers without having to worry too much about one household hoarding all the food and firewood and leaving everyone else to starve or freeze.   It's really fun and relaxing, even if my doctors do keep poisoning themselves (this is why you need schools, I'm sure of it).  --  I really do love character creation. I don't mind playing a pre-written character, but the more customisation options I have over my character, the happier I am. One of my favourite games is Splinter Cell (which has the pre-defined character thing going on) because it's a kickass shootmans game, but you don't actually have to shoot anyone. Most of the time, you don't even have to *touch* anyone, and when you do, you don't have to kill them in all but a few of the missions, and most of Conviction where Fisher appears to have forgotten that he can decide not to kill people if he doesn't want to. Give me that kind of gameplay with a creatable character, maybe throw in some RPG elements so you can specialise in stealth, or guns-blazing badassery, or sneaky, guns-smouldering coolness for the generalists... I'll still be playing that when I'm 60.",,1433140006,0,t3_37orm2

I suspect she wasn't willing to give a shit to engage me in conversation either based on how it was going.   Sometimes you just don't click and you need to recognize it. Be civil, thank them for the opportunity to get to know them a bit, and walk away like two grown adults.  Maybe I've got this all wrong.   With that said, I wish you luck in what you seek.

So then you'd agree that the UFC should get their beak wet on that money, right?  I agree with you by the way. The sponsors mainly (albeit not entirely) just want the promotion during fight week/night. But the next logical step to that analysis is to concede that the UFC is properly entitled to a cut, right?  The Reebok deal sucks, mainly cause (1) it seems to be a solution without a problem; (2) it was done without the fighters' input, albeit that's largely of the fighters' own doing; and (3) there simply isn't enough money in it.    But there's nothing wrong with a piece of the sponsorship money going to the UFC - and the argument that the sponsors have no interest in sponsoring the fighters when they aren't on the UFC stage confirms that.

I would suggest having it with you all the time not just in the car.  What gun in particular comes down to personal preference. Make sure you get extremely familiar with it and try to rent the one you want before you buy it. First you need to decide between revolver or semi automatic. After that you need to figure out what size you like. I definitely suggest not getting something very bulky, my first pistol I bought is what I carry and it is huge. With shorter barrel and you sacrifice accuracy so you need to find a good mix of both. Many people argue that since most altercations happen with him a couple of feet and 21 feet is often the limit for anyone with a night if you are going to defend yourself legally do you want to be able to be spot on at least that far.

It is the dollar value that translates not the brand. So for example you can use a $50 walmart card or a $50 starbucks card and you get 366 days either way. I've paid with different cards and it is always the same. The best deal is to pay as much as possible upfront. If you pay $25 at a time You would need to buy 4 of those to cover a year and that's $100. Pay $50 upfront and get a whole year plus an extra day. Which is a good deal. People pay more than that so their game consoles will let them play online with friends. So $50 for privacy is very reasonable in my opinion. The last thing to add to that is using the gift card is more expensive. If you pay with credit cards or paypal it's only $40 for 366 days since it no longer requires them to use paygarden. But to me the the extra $10 is worth it for the extra anonymity. Using a slightly different example than the one I used above, $50 is cheaper than a new video game.

We were a tree-dwelling species until India collided with Asia about 12 million years ago and it had been like that for at least 20 million years prior to that.  Our habitat changed from jungle to grasslands and back multiple times in the span of a few million years due to the changing weather patterns in the Rift Valley region of eastern Africa.  We almost went extinct multiple times, but once we finally spread out ~100k years ago, we became very well adapted for any environment because our evolutionary niche was our ability to shape our environment with advanced tools as well as our ability to survive on a wide variety of types of food.  The Boisea were a vegetarian proto-human that went extinct because they were highly specialized and evolved to eat grass.  When the grasslands turned to jungle/desert depending on where they were, they died out.

They then point out every complaint you had: chasing ""The One"" and not taking action in life leads to him being depressed, a commitment junkie, and overall *alone* with none of the things he really wants in life (outside of his career). The show was partially about Ted telling his kids about who he had to become to meet their mom after his first breakup with Robin. He had to grow a pair, let go of the love that wasn't working and held him back in life and be smart and active in his pursuit of happiness.   It wasn't always written well, but two episodes really demonstrate this fact: one is the finale (a culmination of everything) and the other is an episode called ""The Time Travelers"": the big twist at the end of the episode is that Ted imagined himself having a good night with his friends, doing the stuff they did in their late twenties. Really he was a 35 year old man drinking in the same spot he always was, longing for a girl he can't get and was getting married, and his other friends had a newborn baby to take care of.

Many bad things are being said about this glorious age, how you are now too old and can't have fun. But the contrary my dear for turning 30 is the greatest gift of all!  No more running on the thread mil or going to the gym for you Missy! You can finally relax and enjoy those comfy sweatpants without the work because the shape you are now is the smallest shape you will be and nothing will change that. So put your feet up and enjoy watching those 20 somethings run around in their hotpants.  While you are relaxing. Open up that fine bottle of red wine to celebrate, heck drink it in your lawn chair. Everyone knows it is acceptable for a 30 year old woman to be drinking alone during the afternoon at home. No one thinks it is sad because they know it is the closest thing you will ever get to a vacation. You aren't going out anymore so all the drinks are for you and you only, how great is that! Look there is the neighbor lady sitting in her chair with her own glass of ""mommy time''. Give her a nice little gesture with the glass to say hello... but not too long we don't want her coming over here. She is 40 after all.   We continue. So once you get off work and you are done with the wine, I am only kidding we are never done with the wine. So once you are off work and drinking wine it is time to enjoy your new hobbies. You have so much more ''you'' time now since you aren't going to the mall or clubs anymore. Your hobbies include, discovering new parts of yourself you never knew you had, like nipple hair or spider veins on the spider veins. Pampering yourself with a bath while reading witty romance novels *a womans secret porn everyone knows about ;)* about 'Rodriquez the Blind and Buttonless horseman' or a classy one like 'For the love of Scottie McMullet' and my favorite 'A Wee bit lower Lassie' by Avril Hunnicut. You will be too tired for any real hankypanky anyways.. or was it hungover? I don't remember but it ain't happening anymore. (Sorry husband). Lastly and mostly I think you will enjoy the cooking. Being 30 means no more watching the weight but not really spending any time making dinner either. The wine kind of puts a stop to that. You will discover 30 new cheeses, dip and types of bread with butter and sausage you never knew existed and this is what you will be eating from now on. It is so efficient just tearing off little bits and pieces and putting them all on a big ol' pizza plate. No times to keep either so just enjoy snacking on this throughout the whole day.   This is all so great you say, but what is the biggest plus about turning 30 you ask? Going to bed of course! Never have you ever enjoyed a good night sleep like you do now. Once you crack that back and snuggle those sore feet under the blanket you are out! Deep dreamless coma like sleep awaits you. Just ask your husband.. he will have tried to wake you a dozen times because of your snoring but it did not work. AMAZING! Note that this sleep will happen anywhere, like on the couch, in the tub or that lawn chair you are in right now. Being exhausted while drunk/hungover and 30 does that too you now.  Enjoy while it lasts before you are completely ancient.. that is when you never sleep.  Hope you enjoy your big day and have a glass for me &lt;3 Happy birthday            ",,0,0,t3_37z6n4

Historically magnetic trainers offer a linear resistance response.  More expensive ones have brains and can vary their resistance with rider speed so that the resistance increases exponentially with speed, just as wind resistance does to a rider on the road.  Fluid trainers naturally offer an exponential resistance curve and so have historically been the resistance trainer of choice for those who can afford one.  In Broad Strokes:  If we're staying outside the (expensive) realm of computer-controlled trainers a fluid trainer will feel much more realistic and (typically) can support stronger riders.  A magnetic trainer will be less expensive than a fluid trainer, and will feel really ""odd"" to many road riders as when you pedal faster the effort required doesn't scale in the manner your muscles anticipate.

I think i should stop panicking when in matchmaking, i do play HS Deathmatch servers and getting some pretty good scores, even sometimes at the top, but as soon as i enter matchmaking, my aim is just plain silver 1. I don't know if it's because i'm worried about dying or anything, but i play alot better on community servers, it's just competitive mode that makes me cringe. My aim is just way worse, maybe because i know it isn't HS and that i just spray2win at their body and hoping for a kill lol. Atleast that's what those others do, run, shoot = headshot. :/ Btw i know matchmaking servers are 64 tick, but i doubt that is the reason behind it.  edit: i think i also have the habit of ""as soon as i spot enemy"" i crouch and shoot from 1.6. :P",,0,0,t1_crrb4n0

Then you're building up not merely an idea, but the idea of a friend. You'll add in all those details that *you* care about and that resonate with you, but they will bore the daylights out of everyone else. And you'll be ticked off no one likes your obviously deep and interesting character you spent so much time on. Other people just won't be in on the jokes or the weirdly specific details, and they'll often be really put off by it.  This is a dangerous almost as great as Mary Sues.  Take inspiration from life, sure, but be careful. Even in original fiction this can lead you down a bad path. Most people seem to read fanfic primarily for the characters they know and love. Mixing any OCs and canon characters is tricky because of this. Even ones based on or inspired by people as iconic as Tesla.  Maybe just write a fic centered on your OC in the Harry Potter universe, and have it be mostly about them. That usually goes over better. People who like those sorts of stories will read them, and those who don't won't try to bare it for the sake of your interesting and original plots.",,0,0,t1_crqs5t8

They use their checkbooks.  Period.  So does Microsoft.  You should probably not try and pretend words mean something they don't.    The console is all but dead in Japan.  A games platform is a games platform.  Period.  3ds outsold ps4 more than 3 to 1 in 2014.  The ps vita even outsold the ps4.  Both consoles are anemic in Japan.  Sony has always offered titles unique to Japan for that market and Microsoft has never bothered because that isn't their focus.  You should probably stop hanging on to one small corner of the world trying to pass off the exception as the rule in yet another attempt to not be wrong.    Every one of your responses starts with vague counterpoints that say nothing, this last going so far as to attempt to distort the meaning of a word.  If you wish to hang your hat on a handful of forgettable indie ports nobody will play as ""more"", be my guest, but quantity is not quality.  There are currently 174 playable Xbox one games to sony's 181, and that's with near monopoly in Japan where titles exist with no offering from Microsoft.   Hmmm.  You sure you're comfortable with calling that dominant?  I addressed your points verbatim....again.  With relevant counterpoints, again....  Now we get to see where you put the goal posts this time.

As for going hypoglycaemic, I've probably been hypo thousands of times. It's not a problem for me and I recognise the symptoms and know how to avoid it. The only thing I won't do is inject before working out. That's just a route to hypo city and ruins a good workout.

Ah, that is a difference, there - in my past relationships I have never been the one to make the 1st move - my own interest has never developed until at least a few weeks into ""testing the waters"" with a new partner. Which still blows my mind because, these were all friends I had long been emotionally intimate with. Even now knowing I am not alone feeling this way, part of me still feels broken, or at least like I am ""faking it."" (There is 1 exception - my best friend for the last 10 years. Started developing a crush on him a couple years ago, he has never expressed interest in me that way. And he is not among the 2-3 I mentioned I would give a chance!

Nor is it any kind of protection against future election fraud/non-citizen voting.  It certainly isn't racist, in and of itself.  &gt;The actual effect of voter ID laws is only to disenfranchise minority voters.  No, the actual effect is intended to prevent voter fraud.  See previous link.  Bear in mind, the federal government [now requires that everyone in this country enroll in some form of private/government insurance, under threat of financial penalty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_mandate#Health_insurance_in_the_US).  With that in mind, I don't think you can argue that doing the absolute minimum to prove one's citizenship before voting in national elections is prohibitively onerous.  &gt;They see demographic shifts, and they will do whatever is necessary to ensure they keep their jobs.  When non-citizens vote overwhelmingly for a specific party, it's in that party's interest to go out of their way not to do anything to prevent that behavior, however illegal.  &gt;Election fraud may very well be an issue on occasion, but that has more to do with those in charge of the systems for managing votes than it does with individual voters.

Early game you'll get your ass handed to you by anything that moves, and late-game you often have to deal with unique spawns of +1000, many of whom will literally tear through your troops.   But mid-game? I always found it harder to actually get established in Floris. There's less renown and less cash to go around, and high tier troops are harder to get.   Don't be put off Pendor though! Just learn which sorts of partied to avoid in the early game, and get a companion with pathfinding so you can run the hell away when you have to. There are still plenty of viable targets early on!   To answer your second question, I leave everything on hardest except damage to myself. I'm playing to challenge myself and have fun, but getting knocked out at the start of a battle is neither of those things.

A good recovery meal/bar/shake is a good idea - something with about a 4:1 carbs-to-protein ratio.  Lowfat chocolate milk is my go-to.  There is a lot of conflicting information about eating calories back.  I've found that, for the most part, with lower mileage, you don't need to focus much on getting those calories back, and it's better to eat when you're hungry (*actually* hungry, not just bored.) The issue takes care of itself there.  When you start running longer, that's when you want to consider eating back more calories.  I burned about ~1000 calories on my last run and my hunger really doesn't reflect what I need to get back from that.  What I do is mark it in MFP and then carry it over to a second day.  I don't always get all the calories back - you don't always need to - but I also don't need a 900 calorie deficit or I get really tired, irritable and hangry.  I know that's a bit non-specific but I labored over the same question because most fitness advice is based on (a) weight loss, and; (b) lifting performance, not endurance sports.

If someone is dying of thirst in a desert, and you have enough water to share, you do so.  If automation makes nearly everyone on Earth redundant, you provide the means to keep them alive and happy because we have the means to do so.  Beyond that, though - what exactly are you fighting so hard for?  The 40 hour work week?  In the early 1900s they thought we would have a 10 hour work week by now, and *we could*...if we wanted to.  The idea that 11 out of every 16 hours need to be spent either at work or traveling to and from work is outdated and sad.  How many of us genuinely enjoy our jobs?  If a robot can do that work, why would any of us fight to the death for the right to keep doing it?  Automation and robots give us the unparalleled opportunity to live a life of leisure and creativity.  Ever wanted to write a book?  Give it a shot!  Think of all the composers, musicians, authors, artists, even scientists who have opted for more ""realistic"" careers pushing papers for a decent salary.    Imagine a world in which there are no homeless people stinking up alleys and doorways, no ""shady characters"" hanging out in parks at night.  That could be the society you live in, one which getting fired doesn't mean your life completely falling apart.  Sure, taxes will go up, but think of how much more fun it would be to own and operate a restaurant if you have robots instead of employees and sales through the roof because people have spending money to eat out.

Everytime I try back up, I lift light and try to focus heavily on form but I always end up tweaking something in my lower back. Squats and deads just put a ton of strain on your spine.  Anyway, I'd highly suggest doing lunges. Try doing set of 20 lunges with dumbbells. Find like a lane in the gym where you can do 10 steps forward and 10 back. I don't think I've ever done a single lower body exercise that's as taxing as lunges. They will destroy the quads and are not very taxing on the back. I did weighted lunges + machine leg press for my heavily leg lifts and then did leg curls and leg extensions just to finish them off. For not involving squats or deads, it's a pretty solid lower body workout. I don't think any exercise is probably as good as squats for lower body, but you can still get a good workout in with other exercises and with a minimal risk of injury.",,0,0,t1_crr97rt

They are simply at a different frequency to radio.   All wireless communication is via electro-magnetic waves. And thus, they need to be somehow told apart. However, luckily there are many different frequencies of these waves. Therefore, the government allocate certain frequencies for certain public and private wireless communication. So your radio will receive either an analogue or digital signal at a specific frequency. Whereas, the mobile phone will transmit at another frequency. Allowing them to work simultaneously without interfering. So your radio will only be able to receive a range from X-Y wheres the mobile phone will only be able to transmit/ receive at P-Q.  Also, as a side note if your interested... Your mobile phone need to constantly be near a mast, and relays regularly to it. If it moves too far from a mast it will connect to another. When it initiates a call, the mast will allocate it a frequency band for that call data (their voice) to be transferred. And allocate it another frequency band for your voice to be transferred. Your phone receives your analogue sound and converts it to digital, sends it to the mast, and it reaches the other person. However the data sent is of low quality, so the provider uses clever algorithms to increase audio clarity, reduce noise, and compensate to make the voice sound natural. This gets sent to the mobile, then the phone converts it to analogue, and transmits it out the speaker at the other end.",,1433117860,0,t3_380mjq

As for the verbosity, I think the first couple paragraphs are the most egregious examples; nothing else really brought me out of the story.  And for what it's worth, I think you've done an *excellent* job of using your style to convey the experience of watching the events as a TV show rather than reading about them.  I just think that by doing so, you lose some of the ability to explore the internal emotions and struggles of the characters (if you've read A Song of Ice and Fire (the Game of Thrones books), think of Tyrion and Cersei's chapters in the last two books, and compare them to the show's adaptation).    I think this especially hurts Pearl's talk with Steven about leaving Earth, and Pearl's argument with Greg; we don't get to feel her emotions with her, and descriptions of her body language are not as powerful as *seeing* it in the show.  Furthermore, with Pearl and Greg's argument, our inability to see her emotions deeper than: &gt; her fists balled by her side, and she was seething with barely contained rage  means that the argument doesn't have it's full emotional power.  Also, the quick resolution of the argument at the end seems strange.  If we got a glimpse into Pearl or Greg's thoughts, they'd certainly think something about how they should stop arguing for Steven's sake, and I imagine Pearl comntinuing to have thoughts about the confrontation even after its over, while she's confronting Steven.",,0,0,t1_crr9nwu

Would your critiques of a FF7 remake not apply also to a normal FF game? Like, I don't see how your critiques apply specifically to an FF7 remake but don't apply to, say, FF15 or a potential FF16. FF15 is gonna take, and did take, 5+ years, as would an FF16. Both are, and will be, super expensive to make. Console generations being shorter also affects FF15 and FF16.   Presumably an HD-FF7 would make just as much money as FF15 or another HD FF main series game, and take as much time to produce and the budgets would be similar. Since that's the case, what about your argument is specific to an FF7 remake that doesn't apply to FF15 or FF16? Or, hell, even FF13?    But, the impetus for Square to make an HD-FF7? 10.9 million sales of FF7 to date, making it the highest selling FF game in the series. If they do make it, it'd be because they believe they can capture those same numbers. ",,0,0,t3_380lzl

There are some episodes that have a main plot in them but a huge number of them are stand alone episodes. I mean, you should get a feel for the main characters before diving in, but it's not that hard. I got into it watching it with a friend and then I went back and started from the beginning. Any first season of a series is going to be rough.   My recommendation would be steer clear of any episodes with like flame princess or the lich because those need to be chronological. A couple good ones I think would be Puhoy, Marcelines closet, bmo noire, and the one where finn wants to go to the movies, I think it's called go with me? And also dungeon because it has the approximate knowledge cat.   I think that has a good mix of non main plot episodes that aren't too silly or bizarre like that God forsaken circus one or fucking chips and ice cream.   Edit: also, what was missing is a great one with most of the main characters and lots of music. You could even start with this one I think. ",,1433119933,0,t3_37z3is

It's not a moralizing film, though. It's supposed to be reflective, not judgmental, and if the kind of antics these guys pull appeal to you, that says something about you more than it does about the film.  Not that anyone's judging, it's a Scorsese movie, and it comments on uncomfortable aspects of society that are so engrained that they're subconscious.  If you want to be part of the tasteless greed that Belfort embodies, that's a perfectly legitimate place in America, though there is an invisible line that Belfort crosses, and you don't want to end up like him.  This is not the same as Goodfellas, which focuses on an immigrant subculture who are bound to fail; this is about people who are even closer than the mafia to the line between being authority and being a criminal element.  And in the end Belfort does ok, though it's a definite fall from grace.  He can't do drugs anymore and loses his fraternity, his wealth, his wife.  This is because of his hubris, trying to exploit loopholes in the system he had always wanted to be a part of. It's important that the stock market crashes on his first week: he had always wanted to fit in, be a white collar worker, a fairly conventional person, but finds that the only way to succeed in Wall Street, or perhaps the only way worth succeeding in, is the boom and bust high risk lifestyle that produced the '87 crash.  He sort of accepts at a certain point that the only way to be part of the traditional elite is to start there, so he basically says fuck them, and hires a bunch of idiots to do the same job.  It's a rock and roll move, and I think you are supposed to sympathize with this spirit on some level, but his hubris comes into play when he thinks he can make money presenting himself as of the elite (Stratton Oakmont) but in reality do things his own way.  The system does not let you do things your own way.  Belfort is obviously right when he tells the FBI agent there are criminals worse than him on Wall Street itself, but he has committed the greater crime of breaking with cultural norms: he's a cultural criminal.  This is not so far off from Goodfellas, except that in Goodfellas, like the Godfather, the cultural crime being committed is simply coming from an immigrant background (and the differing business practices that are symptoms a broader culture clash in America).

I'd like to address a couple of your comments:   &gt;Strict scrutiny asks that a compelling state interest must be in play: here you and Stevens (as per dissent) are arguing that the integrity of the electoral process is the interest.  At least as far as I'm concerned, this is only half of the equation. Yes, I think that preserving the integrity of the electoral process is a compelling state interest. However, in addition to that, I think that fostering public confidence in the integrity of our elections in a compelling state interest as well; this is the important part. So, even if ensuring an equitable electoral process isn't a compelling state interest (as you seem to say), and allowing corporate funded speech doesn't threaten the integrity of our elections, the fact that the vast majority of the citizenry believes that itt does presents a compelling state interest in ensuring confidence in our elections.   &gt;But this argument fails to see that the integrity of this process also requires a free exercise of speech and a free marketplace of ideas.   I disagree with this. This is about a balancing of interests. An equitable electoral process requires a certain level of free speech. Too little speech rights results in a hindering of the process, and too much (or rather, speech being used in unjust ways) results in the same. The whole issue is finding the middle ground between the two extremes.    &gt; The state interest of protecting the integrity of elections must also protect the integrity of the free marketplace of ideas.   I think a better way of saying this might be to say that the State's interest in ensuring the integrity of our elections (which, as I just explained, if more about ensuring public confidence in elections) must be *tempered* by the interest in fostering a robust marketplace of ideas.   That said, as I'm sure you know, a pretty forceful argument can be made that corporate speech of the brand allowed by Cit. United does nothing but degrade the marketplace of ideas. I don't think we should expect to have a well informed electorate when one group is able to drown out the ideas of millions of individuals.    &gt;I agree the system isn't perfect, but **restrictions brought forth must not infringe on fundamentL rights such as speech.** (emphasis added)   Of course, as I assume you know, this is not true. Restrictions absolutely can infringe on fundamental rights so long as they can pass scarcity scrutiny.   ",,0,0,t1_crqnpz2

A few things look more spectacular through it as it feels more immersive than the 24, but it might be better to use if I didn't have GOTO. I do like the 16mm. For some things where I'd like to see just a little more detail, I think the 16mm works quite well. I also kept going for the 16mm for nebula. Found myself mostly using the 24 and 16, and sometimes with the powermate, especially for Saturn. 12mm and 31mm have had the least amount of use so far. I haven't had a clear enough viewing to get a sharp image from the 12mm with powermate on Saturn. The 16mm with powermate has worked well though.",,0,0,t1_crfe39e

What is that?? The only thing I can think of is that it is supposed to allow cyclists to pull off the road and use the pedestrian crossing to get to the station on the other side, although I don't see any reason not to just make a normal right turn there. But just look at how it wants you to turn off the road (hopefully avoiding the helpfully placed railings), then *immediately* stop and dismount, all in about a bike length of actual space! Better hope nobody is behind you I guess... If they wanted to have something like this, it could have been started from the bus stop a few metres further back, leaving much more space and avoiding the need to turn and dodge through the railings while also not dumping you straight into the end of a potentially busy pedestrian crossing. The cycle lanes on both sides of the road beyond this point are also very narrow, barely a bike width if that.   Can't argue with you on the Sheffield one though, that's a bit silly :) To be fair providing more bike racks is one of the few things I have seen a noticeable improvement in over the last few years. I live in Glasgow and have noticed more and more of them appearing in useful places, and they also brought in a city-wide bike hire scheme last year which seems to have been a success. And there are some cycle paths around here which are actually quite nice to ride on too, so I'm not saying things are ALL bad, I just wish the councils would get some people who have actual experience of using the existing infrastructure to help them develop new infrastructure, instead of often continuing to make the same mistakes over and over.   The other thing that would be very nice is if motorists would stop using cycle lanes as parking areas. They can't complain about cyclists not using them and then pretend they don't exist when they want to park. [This](https://goo.gl/maps/RLz73) is a busy street I use a lot. It has cycle lanes almost all the way along it, on both sides, but most of the time you simply cannot use them because of people parking like this. Incidentally that corner was also featured on the ""Facility of the month"" recently for [this piece of stupidity](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pete.meg/wcc/facility-of-the-month/February2015.htm) - it's been there for ages, and is basically a tacit admission that the following piece of cycle lane is now a parking area that just happens to have been painted green for some reason.

On the fourth day of Onam celebrations (Nalaam Onam), performers painted like tigers and hunters in bright yellow, red, and black dance to the beats of instruments like Udukku and Thakil. Literal meaning of Pulikali is the 'play of the tigers' hence the performance revolve around the theme of tiger hunting. The folk art is mainly practiced in Thrissur district of Kerala. Best place to watch the show is at Swaraj Round, Thrissur on the fourth day of Onam, where Pulikali troupes from all over the district assemble to display their skills. The festival attracts thousands of people to the Thrissur city. Pulikali is also performed during various other festive seasons.  The origin of Pulikali dates back to over 200 years, when the Maharaja Rama Varma Sakthan Thampuran, the then Maharaja of Cochin, is said to have introduced the folk art, who wanted to celebrate Onam with a dance that reflected the wild and macho spirit of the force. Later, Muslim soldiers of the British Army stationed in Thrissur in the army cantonment area (Pattalam Road) used to celebrate with great fervor. They popularised the folk genre with steps and body language peculiar to a tiger being stalked by a hunter, enacting a play of the hunter and the beast. Along with the celebrations, they used to perform the art form decked as tigers with peculiar steps resembling the tiger, then known as 'Pulikkettikali' which was immensely enjoyed by the locals. Pulikali in Thrissur is held in memory of this event.[2]",,0,0,t3_380lu0

The youngest brother ate play-dough. There was play-dough stuck to everything. The house smelled like breath. Shag carpets needs to be cleaned every couple of years, but theirs' were matted and sticky. The entire house was shag carpet except for the bathroom and kitchen, which were peeling brown linoleum. The father was a massage therapist, so people were always coming and going and wandering around the house in their undies. The oldest brother showed the younger brother and I porn when we were 9 and 5. The doorknobs were always sticky. Once, their house was broken into. The intruders smashed all of the mirrors that lined the walls of the 70s living room, and the family never fixed it. Their cleaning lady always looked really overwhelmed and sad, and we weren't allowed to talk to her.",,0,0,t3_37zyk6
